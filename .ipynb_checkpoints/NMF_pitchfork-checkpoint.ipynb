    "text = \"Imagine a graphic showing all the bands the five members of Tortoise were in before they came together and then all the bands they went on to play with after. At the top of the funnel you have groups ranging from dreamy psych-rock to earthy post-punk crunch, including Eleventh Dream Day, Bastro, Slint, and the Poster Children; on the “post-Tortoise” end are groups focusing on electro-jazz and twangy instrumental rock like Isotope 217, Chicago Underground, and Brokeback. In this graphic, Tortoise is the choke point, the one project that has elements of all these sounds but is never defined by nor committed to any of them.Instead, Tortoise floats free, a planchette moving over a Ouija board guided by 10 sets of fingers, where everyone watches the arrow float in one direction but no one is quite sure how it gets there or who is doing the pushing. No album in the band’s initial run embodied that like their third, 1998’s TNT. Weirdly beautiful and impossible to pin down, TNT was a fulcrum, a place where the musical values of the past (instrumental proficiency, deliberate composition) met the digital future.But first we should start with that past, with a rhythm section, or rather, two of them. The first of these came together when drummer John Herndon and bassist Doug McCombs became friends and started playing together in Chicago in the early 1990s. Entering a studio with producer Brad Wood to record an early single, Herndon and McCombs overdubbed multiple parts to flesh out the sound but realized they needed more musicians for what they had in mind. They played the tapes for their acquaintances, drummer John McEntire and bassist Bundy K. Brown, who formed the rhythm section for the Louisville-based post-hardcore group Bastro, and soon after, the four players, along with percussionist Dan Bitney, became Tortoise.If the early ’90s was the perfect time for a band like Tortoise to emerge, Chicago was the perfect place. The city’s burgeoning independent music scene was attracting national attention. After the post-Nirvana alternative rock explosion, the hunt for “the next Seattle” was on, and Chicago was one of the candidates. In 1993, Billboard published a piece touting Chicago as “Cutting Edge’s New Capital,” citing the buzz around artists like Liz Phair, Urge Overkill, and Smashing Pumpkins. But if the national press was more focused on the MTV-ready alt acts, that meant that the underground was free to do their thing far from the glare of the spotlight. For Chicago, the building blocks of such a scene were the city’s record labels, particularly Touch and Go, Drag City, and, beginning in 1995, when it moved from New York, an upstart imprint called Thrill Jockey launched by former Atlantic A&R rep Bettina Richards.After bassist Brown had been replaced by ex-Slint guitarist and bassist Dave Pajo, Tortoise began moving fluidly between musical worlds. An experimental strain of music using rock instrumentation was emerging, and “post-rock” seemed to fit as a blanket description. Initially, the term applied to UK bands like Disco Inferno and Bark Psychosis, but a framework for understanding this music from the U.S. was laid out by critic Simon Reynolds in a late 1995 piece for The Wire. As Reynolds pointed out, the American flavor of post-rock (the piece highlights Tortoise, Labradford, UI, Stars of the Lid, and more) could be thought of as anti-grunge, a music that suggested a headier and less earthbound alternative to the alternative. “Grunge literally means ‘grime,’ ‘muck,’ ‘dirt,’ Reynolds wrote. “It’s appropriate that so many of those in revolt against Grunge’s earthly passion have turned to science fiction and outer space in order to free up their imaginations.”Guitars dominated the grunge-derived strand of music, but post-rock left room for electronics and other instruments. McEntire was Tortoise’s resident tech wizard, and the band’s M.O. moved from the thudding beats of the debut into something that could fit with what was happening with various strands of electronic music. On Virgin’s 1995 set of dark atmospheric electronica, Macro Dub Infection, Tortoise appeared alongside Spring Heel Jack, 4 Hero, Tricky, and the Mad Professor. And in 1996, they were included in Mo’ Wax’s blunted head-nodding 2-CD trip-hop set Headz 2A, sandwiched between songs by DJ Krush and Massive Attack. Tortoise didn’t exactly fit on either compilation—they were too disjointed, too ready to leave the groove behind if something else caught their fancy. But these compilation placements helped to reframe their music as a studio creation first, something assembled from parts.Remixing was in vogue, and Tortoise embraced it. The astonishing 20-minute journey “Djed,” the opening track from their second album, 1996’s Millions Now Living Will Never Die, put the idea of after-performance manipulation at the center of the piece, as a deep-pocket groove is born, develops, and shatters halfway through in a moment of digital haywire that sounded like a mistake. That garbled transmission when the piece implodes provided a clue as to what the next record might be about.TNT took the ideas of “Djed” further into the creative possibilities of nonlinear editing. It was recorded to hard disk via Pro Tools, a relatively new idea on the music scene when they started working on the album in late 1996 (Stereolab’s Dots and Loops, engineered by McEntire around the same time, was another early entry for the technology). TNT is a record where copy, cut, paste, and undo reign supreme. Individual parts were worked up in rehearsals, recorded in various combinations, and later reconfigured into new pieces of music by McEntire and the band.One of the delicious tensions of TNT is its ex post facto assembly. It doesn’t really sound like music created by careful manipulation of each bit and put together from parts. You almost always have a sense that individual people, not machines, are playing each part and even though the players’ skill ranges from “highly accomplished” to “virtuoso,” the pieces also sound human. You can see hands on keys and people standing over drum kits. Beats are a bit off-kilter, the guitar seems in dialogue with the bass.TNT’s opening title track is the most live-sounding cut on the record, but it, too, was carefully built one part at a time. As it begins, the cymbals and snare taps are like the tide rolling in, the skitters and crashes are as jazzy as Tortoise get, and out of this foamy pile emerges Jeff Parker’s immortal guitar line. Parker was new to the band, and was the first player to bring serious jazz chops, with his history with Chicago’s legendary collective AACM. He announced his arrival in Tortoise with a guitar phrase that might be the group’s most memorable single moment, a riff that sums up not only the album’s mood but the spirit of an entire era. Parker’s 12-note phrase seems to ask a question and then half answer it, and because it conveys the feeling of an incomplete thought, it leaves a space for the listener to fill. Driven by that guitar refrain, which loops throughout the track, “TNT” folds in horns, a sequencer, and chunky bass as Parker offers counterpoint phrases. You can feel both how “played” it is alongside the album’s modular nature, where each part is slid into place as it grows and then explodes. “TNT” conveys possibility—it’s a musical expression of what it feels like to wonder about the future on an album that feels like it’s living inside of it.Nothing else on the record is quite so dynamic or organic. Instead, TNT settles into a liminal zone that straddles genres and threatens to slip into the background but never does. It’s a vague record, but that’s actually one of its strengths—the music frames uncertainty, leaves avenues unexplored, and sounds a little different each time you hear it. Many of the tracks flow one into the next, and motifs appear and then reappear later. A few songs become loosely joined pairs as one idea is introduced and then explored later from a different angle. It’s an album that seems to be in conversation with itself.The hiss of the closing cymbals in “TNT” cross-fades into the bass-driven mood piece “Swung From the Gutters,” a quiet track that feels like a lost interlude on the Grateful Dead’s Blues for Allah. This focus on a simple melody connects it to “The Suspension Bridge at Iguazú Falls,” which shows up later on the album but unfolds at a much more deliberate pace. None of these nods to genre are played completely straight. “I Set My Face to the Hillside” opens with the voices of playing children before a nylon-stringed guitar enters, carrying a memory of flamenco that blooms out like the soundtracks of Ennio Morricone. That sound was already an established template for Tortoise, but here they tweak it. On “Set My Face,” you can almost hear the clop of horseshoes in the drums, but then the main melody enters, played on melodica, and you imagine Augustus Pablo meeting the Ventures uptown.Other references are more of-the-moment. On “Almost Always Is Nearly Enough,” Tortoise do a convincing imitation of the squelching, endearingly awkward electro-pop that Mouse on Mars was releasing on Thrill Jockey around this time, complete with fluttering programmed beats and a squawking robotic vocal. That vocal continues through “Jetty,” which gets close to dance music proper, with a jittery forward-leaning beat. “The Equator” is loping electro, a wobbly gurgle of a bassline percolating below a twinkly electronic drone and a slide guitar. The defining word for all these tracks is “almost”—they hint at the work of other artists and embody a range of styles, but they never go all the way. Tortoise were never interested in making actual dance music, the same way they never wanted to improvise in a conventional way. The music is about what happens in the cracks.“The focus is definitely shifting to the treble over the last couple of records,” McEntire told Billboard in early 1998. He was talking about the use of mallet instruments, especially the marimba, which pops up frequently on TNT. “Ten-Day Interval” and its companion piece “Four-Day Interval” pick up the Steve Reich thread that wound through parts of Millions Now Living and make it more explicit. “Ten-Day” is comparatively dense and busy, while “Four-Day” feels like a ghost of its predecessor, ticking along at half the pace and unfolding with twice the space. Tortoise’s take on Reichian repetition has an appealing pop edge to it, foregoing long-form trance induction and instead laying out a basic premise: tweak the rhythm with bits of piano, bass, and percussion, and get out. All the pieces function together, and none, with the possible exception of the title track, draw undue attention to themselves.For their first two albums, Tortoise received almost nothing but raves, but the reaction to TNT was initially mixed. It seemed to pull back slightly after the first two albums strained against limitations. Where the band once shattered conventions, now their music was quiet, pretty, and worked in the background of a dinner party. SPIN thought TNT was accomplished but ultimately bloodless and antiseptic, while The Wire called it “one of the least explosive records ever made, and one of the most gently perplexing.” Neither criticism is unfair, but both inadvertently point to what makes this record special—its essential in-between-ness. Jeff Parker told CMJ in 1998, “People expect everything to be so obvious. But life isn’t like that, so why should music be like that?” TNT is not about certainty. It’s a free-floating work that tends to find a different meaning everywhere it lands, an album that’s beautiful on the surface but gets harder to parse the deeper you go. To enjoy it is to embrace that uneasy sense of not-knowing, of luxuriating in a sound that doesn’t tell you what to feel.\""

    "The year 1991 was a significant one in Jane's Addiction lore, marking both the launch of the L.A. art-rockers' Lollapalooza travelling-circus experiment and the announcement of the band's dissolution. Now, on the 20th anniversary of those events, both brands are still making headlines, despite enduring extended periods of inactivity, aborted restarts, and organizational restructuring. And it's perhaps no coincidence that both Jane's Addiction and Lollapalooza have evolved in exactly the same way: What were once unpredictable, chaotic forces have inevitably mutated into well-oiled, monolithic entities bearing little of the charm and character of their original incarnations. This circumstance is not lost on frontman/Lolla visionary Perry Farrell who, on Jane's Addiction's new album, proudly declares, \"We've become a big business/ A galaxy merger!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if that line is intended to be a metaphor for a blossoming romantic relationship, the fact that Farrell's singing of love in the language of commerce effectively sums up the proficient but perfunctory nature of The Great Escape Artist, Jane's Addiction's fifth official album, their second comeback record (following 2003's Strays), and the first release since the short-lived reintroduction of founding bassist Eric Avery into the fold for a 2009 tour. No doubt, their various attempts to keep Jane's alive over the past decade have taught Farrell, guitarist Dave Navarro, and drummer Stephen Perkins that replacing Avery requires more than just finding a talented bass player. In many respects, Avery defined the band's sonic identity and mystique; think of any Jane's classic, and often the first thing that pops into your head is one of those ominous, propulsive basslines. So while the middling Strays tried to plug session vet Chris Chaney into the dynamic, for The Great Escape Artist, the band makes a more concerted effort at revitalization, recruiting everyone from TV on the Radio's Dave Sitek to Guns N' Roses bassist Duff McKagan to Morocco's Master Musicians of Joujouka-- a trifecta of collaborators who respectively play to Jane's Addiction's affinities for heady atmosphere, raunchy hard rock, and tribal-percussion jams.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the outset, The Great Escape Artist lives up to that on-paper potential: Farrell's freak-scene re-indoctrination \"Underground\" and Avery-directed invective \"End to the Lies\" (featuring the Joujouka crew) open the album with a pair of promisingly authoritative metallic grinds that sound like they were grafted from the slow-motion mid-section of Ritual de lo Habitual's \"Stop\", but with Sitek's chrome-plated textures adding a post-apocalyptic ambience that greatly complements Navarro's eerie six-string squeals. But there's a palpable dip in intensity from there on in, as The Great Escape Artist gets mired in the not-quite-rock/not-quite-ballad purgatory that defines so much post-grunge alt-radio.\n",
    "\n",
    "As slickly produced as Nothing's Shocking and Ritual de lo Habitual were, you always got the sense that Jane's Addiction were a band of four interconnected personalities contributing distinct, individual parts to the majestic whole. But even compared to the nu-metalloid sheen of Strays, The Great Escape Artist's intricate, heavily lacquered production-- courtesy of Muse-man Rich Costey-- has the effect of making Jane's Addiction sound like an anonymous assemblage of oversaturated recording tracks. More so than Avery's commanding presence, what's really missing here is Jane's Addiction's sense of playfulness, absurdity, and rhythmic verve. Beyond hard-charging closer \"Words Right Out of My Mouth\", powerhouse drummer Perkins is given scant opportunity to flex his percussive muscle and is instead relegated to playing the mild-mannered time-keeper on melodramatic turns like \"Twisted Tales\" and \"Splash a Little Water on It\", while Sitek's bass contributions are barely perceptible underneath the glossy sheen. And for a frontman who's always been happy to flaunt his own ridiculousness, Farrell is surprisingly humorless here, the quirky character studies and brash swagger of old replaced by straight-faced pleading and vague second-person admonishments. Sure, the line, \"You were the foreskin/ I was the real head,\" reads as hilarious but, coming from a Jew, probably isn't meant as a term of endearment.\n",

    "There is, however, one song here-- \"Broken People\"-- that cuts through The Great Escape Artist's sleek surface and provides a glimpse of the charismatic, affective band that Jane's once were and still could be. (Surprisingly, it's one of McKagan's three co-writes.) And, as per the standard set by \"I Would For You\", \"Jane Says\", and \"Then She Did...\", \"Broken People\" is a melancholic reverie dedicated to a tragic female protagonist, though instead calling upon his usual cast of junkies and eccentrics, Farrell updates the archetype to paint a sympathetic portrait of a sex-vid-shilling celebutante. Despite the sensationalistic subject matter, Jane's treat it with an understated elegance, thanks to Navarro's beautifully restrained guitar line, a sensitive but not mawkish vocal from Farrell, and-- rare for this album-- a concise, unfussy arrangement; even the amped-up, fist-pump treatment applied to the third verse can't sully the song's graceful sway. In a world where truly nothing is shocking, Jane's Addiction have understandably lost the will and desire to be as outrageous and confrontational as they once were. But as \"Broken People\" attests, the most effective way for a big business to surprise you is through a simple, humble act of charity.'''"

or indie rock today was shaped by popular    uk bands—thecure  neworder  depeche mode—who came of age with punk but used its principles to forge a synth centric mode of pop music wholly liberated from

      "Judging from crowd reactions at last month's Faith No More concert in Toronto, the band's signature song is no longer \"Epic\", the star-making, stagedive-launching anthem that thrust the band's 1989 album, The Real Thing, into the Billboard Top 20. No, the most apeshit response was reserved for the lead single from 1992's notorious, radio-repelling Angel Dust, \"Midlife Crisis\"—which made sense, given that the majority of Faith No More's audience is now old enough to have gone through one. But if the moment confirmed the long-term triumph of Faith No More's artistic peak over its commercial one, the band weren't ones to bask in the validation. Just as \"Midlife Crisis\" was about to emerge from its brooding mid-song breakdown into its climactic final chorus, Faith No More deviously denied the crowd the opportunity for one last cathartic sing-along. Instead, they kicked into a spot-on approximation of Boz Scaggs' 1976 proto-disco perennial \"Lowdown\", over which frontman Mike Patton sang the remaining lyrics to \"Midlife Crisis\" in his most lecherous lounge-lizard warble.It was a perfect Faith No More moment, crystallizing both their contrarian impulses and this ostensible hard rock group's long-time fascination with pop music. While it's common for metal and post-hardcore bands to pummel chart hits and golden oldies into submission, Faith No More have always seemed in awe of pop music's shimmering surfaces and disarming capabilities. As that \"Lowdown\" prank in Toronto illustrated, Faith No More don't cover soft-rock songs to make fun of them, but to make light of themselves, to deflate the chest-puffing machismo endemic to metal and unravel the tinfoil of hard rock's proverbial cucumber. And as these expanded, double-disc reissues of The Real Thing and Angel Dust reaffirm, Faith No More are a flamboyant, omnivorous pop act trapped in a metal band's body; their sound is the musical equivalent of a G.I. Joe doll dressed in a Barbie bikini with its limbs torn off. But if their reputation has been defined by a penchant for maniacal mash-ups, the band's deep-seated reverence for songcraft has always been the most perverse thing about them.For younger listeners whose tastes were shaped by the genre-agnostic Internet, it may be hard to square The Real Thing with its reputation as an alt-rock trailblazer. Because, for the most part, what we largely consider alt- or indie-rock today was shaped by popular '80s UK bands—The Cure, New Order, Depeche Mode—who came of age with punk but used its principles to forge a synth-centric mode of pop music wholly liberated from rock's blues-based tradition. Their California alt-rock counterparts, while also raised on punk, were less interested in opening up a new emotional and sonic vocabulary than bastardizing their formative influences: think Jane's Addiction's goth take on Zeppelin grandeur, Primus' bizarro-world Rush revisionism, Fishbone's skewed ska, or the Red Hot Chili Peppers' mosh-pit updates of Dylan and Stevie Wonder. It speaks volumes about the conservatism of mainstream American music at the time that all a rock band needed was some slap bass and dyed dreads to get consigned to the \"120 Minutes\" set.Amid their funky-punky peers, however, Faith No More were the freaks who didn't quite fit in with the other freaks. Neither as overtly sexual as Jane's Addiction or the Chili Peppers, nor as wilfully weird as their Bay Area buds in Primus, their lineup represented a veritable Breakfast Club detention room of rock archetypes, fusing elements of metal, prog rock, hip-hop and new wave. And it's that last element that ultimately set the band apart—through the omnipresent textural gloss of keyboardist Roddy Bottum, Faith No More were the only band of their ilk to openly embrace the synth-shined sound of '80s UK pop, then considered the antithesis of underground American rock. (Even as late as 1992, Rage Against the Machine were boasting in the liner notes of their debut album that they used \"no synthesizers, keyboards or samples\" as an unassailable measure of their realness.)Faith No More's third album overall (and second to see wide release via Slash/Warner), The Real Thing is the moment where the band's seemingly incompatible aesthetics locked into seamless formation. This can largely be attributed to the arrival of Mike Patton, whose sing/scream vocal gesticulations better personified the manic contradictions in the band's sound than outgoing vocalist Chuck Mosely's bratty monotone. But the band were also more confident in the grandiosity of their sound, with bassist Billy Gould and drummer Mike Bordin's heavy but dextrous rhythms deftly mediating between Bottum's synths and Jim Martin's thrash-schooled shredding. The hair-raising intro to \"From Out of Nowhere\", with the entire band hammering at full throttle, is to this album what \"Ride of the Valkyries\" was to Apocalypse Now, a full-bore battle cry blown up to widescreen scale. And while \"Epic\" was perfectly timed to satiate the then-burgeoning appetite for rap-rock, the most interesting stuff was happening outside of Patton's staccato verses: that bulldozing fanfare of an opening riff, the beaming, anthemic chorus, Martin's Brian May-inspired soloing, that mournful, fish-killing piano coda.But while The Real Thing represents an important chapter in Faith No More's history, there's a reason why the album barely registers on the setlists of the band's current tour: a lot of it is hard to extricate from its date of origin. And that's a function of both its connection to a long-past funk-metal zeitgeist and the band's own subsequent development. It's hard to imagine any band, let alone Faith No More, attempting another song like \"Epic\" today, not just because of lingering associations between rap-rock and Rapestock, but the fact that the vocabularies of hip-hop and rock—once united by a shared affinity for booming breaks and crunchy riffs—have expanded and diverged in vastly different directions. However, Patton's long-abandoned MC moves aren't the only thing that marks The Real Thing as a definite product of 1989. While the dubbed-out title track centerpiece and the explosive \"Zombie Eaters\" (a template for the sort of stentorian power ballads FNM friends Metallica embrace on The Black Album) serve powerful displays of Patton's melodic/monstrous extremes, he had yet to fully emerge as the hydra-headed vocal dynamo we know him as today, while the unnecessary note-for-note cover of \"War Pigs\" is a rare instance of Faith No More approaching an obvious influence in an obvious fashion. (At the very least, it provided Bordin with good practice for his future gig as Bill Ward's understudy.) And in spite of showcasing Bottum's crucial keyboard work, pop songs like \"Falling to Pieces\" and \"Underwater Love\" didn't do much to dissuade skeptics who had pegged Faith No More as Chili Peppers copyists. The band's next album, however, would ensure no one ever confused Patton with Anthony Kiedis ever again.Angel Dust was hardly the spiteful act of career suicide their nervous major-label minders at Warner Bros. anticipated—it actually cracked the Billboard Top 10 and went gold in the U.S., while selling loads more in Europe.

And they were as eager to upset the expectations of industry execs clamoring for another MTV-ready hit as the metalheads in their base who were just showing up for the megaton riffage. What makes Angel Dust an eminently fascinating record is not the fact that a band on the cusp of greater success would deign to release an album with songs called \"Crack Hitler\" and \"Jizzlobber\" that were just as ugly and filthy as their titles suggest. It's that Faith No More's most wantonly subversive album is also their most gorgeously rendered.Unlike other alt-rock opuses of its vintage, Angel Dust didn't feel like a mere Lollapalooza-era update of '70s classic-rock gatefold epics; this was a new, fiercely modernist form of heavy rock music, painstakingly constructed from emerging strains of electronica and sample-based production, international influences and the depths of underground metal.

There is the chanted \"Midlife Crisis\" mid-section that sounds like it was imported from an Enigma record; the pretty pan flute-inspired melody of \"A Small Victory\" that leads to a funky Madchester organ break; \"Be Aggressive\"'s appropriation of high-school cheerleader songs into a homoerotic oral-sex anthem designed to be unwittingly shouted out by the band's mostly straight fans. They're the sort of ideas that sound ridiculous on paper, but are perfectly integrated into the album's elaborate design. Likewise, \"Everything's Ruined\" should be the mess its title suggests, shifting through a bright, bass-popping groove, melancholy verses, a rap-metal bridge, soaring soft-rock chorus and David Gilmour-esque guitar solos; instead, this portrait of familial breakdown proves to be the album's emotional center, with Patton's dejected declaration of the title chorus coming just as the song finally opens up into a sweeping, piano-inflected vista.Faith No More followed up Angel Dust's conceptual complexity with their simplest gesture: a straight-up, I-can't-believe-they're-not-being-ironic cover of the Commodores' 1977 slow-dance standard \"Easy\", which was recorded during the album's sessions but held over for the Songs to Make Love To EP. (It would be absorbed into the tracklist of overseas Angel Dust issues, but really does not fit thematically with the album at all.) \"Easy\" would crack the UK Top 10, and, to date, it's Faith No More's last single to chart on the Billboard Top 100 in the U.S. However, its significance to the band's story is somewhat overemphasized by this reissue, which includes three very similar versions of the song. The current archival campaign was not initiated by the band, but rather the music's current rights holders at Warner/Rhino, who are capitalizing on renewed back-catalogue interest stemming from Faith No More's first new album in 18 years, the self-released Sol Invictus.Both The Real Thing and Angel Dust come appended with an extra disc of period-specific bonus tracks (pared down for the double-vinyl editions), however, Faith No More's high standards of quality control mean the vaults weren't exactly teeming with treasured leftovers. Aside from solid Real Thing-era outtakes \"The Cowboy Song\" and \"Sweet Emotion\" (not an Aerosmith cover, but a dry run for future Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey soundtrack entry \"The Perfect Crime\"), Faith No More's castaways tended to take the form of tossed-off genre exercises, like Zeppelin III-style acoustic interlude \"The Grade\", polka parody \"Das Schutzenfest\", and an Elvisized take on the Dead Kennedys' \"Let's Lynch the Landlord\". The rest of the bonus bounty comprises alternate takes (including some amusing time-capsule examples of early alt-rock dance remixes) and live tracks that don't deviate all too much from the originals, save for Patton's tendency to ad lib House of Pain, Bay City Rollers and Rob Base lyrics into his own.But the unhinged atmosphere of Faith No More's early-'90s concerts provides a convenient yardstick for gauging just how far the band had evolved in three short years—from the metal-damaged misfits comically growling \"SATAN!\" as \"War Pigs\" enters meltdown mode, to the cinematically minded aesthetes who opted to close Angel Dust with a meditative rendition of John Barry's Midnight Cowboy theme. At the time, that choice felt like the biggest WTF gesture on an album full of them, all that crushing brutalism and shape-shifting chicanery anti-climaxing in a moment of pure, unblemished beauty. But the move feels more appropriate now than ever—after all, like John Schlesinger's film, Angel Dust was a source of outrage at the time of its release, but has since ascended to the realm of a modern classic.\n",

      "ASG frontman Jason Shi's voice is the most distinctive part of his North Carolina band's sludgy psychedelia and poppy Southern heavy rock. Which isn't a knock: They're a good band, but it's that voice that adds the \"poppy\" to the previous description. It also makes me think more about rock radio than metal. Shi drives home the hooks with an upper register semi-falsetto that's melodic when it needs to be, with an occasional gruffness. It can bring to mind 90s alternative bands (Jane's Addiction with a Southern twang) as well as a skate rock group you caught on a Powell-Peralta video during the early part of same decade (maybe, in part, because Shi resembles Tony Hawk). When he really puts his back into a note, it sounds like he's levitating.The band's third LP, 2008's Win Us Over, hit me a little after it was released and then became a regular part of my rotation. Their new fourth album, Blood Drive, their first for Relapse, made sense on first listen. The 12-song collection was produced by Grammy-winning engineer Matt Hyde, who's worked with ASG previously. He's also produced albums for Monster Magnet, Sublime, No Doubt, Slayer, Porno for Pyros, and Sum 41, and he knows how to get the big, bright sounds that work best with this band. The quartet aren't afraid of grooves. They don't cower from fist-pumping anthems. It's sunny music that should makes fans of Torche and Queens of the Stone Age perk up their ears.It's not all Shi: ASG know how to write memorable riffs and hooks that really do stick with you. Though they just go by ASG these days, the initials were originally short for All Systems Go, a sentiment that's likely more suited to these guys than whomever sued them way back when and claimed the name for themselves: They pause here and there to insert an acoustic passage, a blues riff, some deep-voiced Americana, or a patch of echoing psych, but for the most part, ASG remain revved up.The lyrics don't match the usually upbeat sound, and that disconnect helps make the band even more interesting. On Blood Drive, Shi's words often focus on the apocalypse and the sky. We get \"Earthwalk\"'s \"All night earth cries beautiful sounds,\" \"Hawkeye\"'s \"Lights out we ride/ Tearing holes in a sunken sky,\"\n",
      "\"Stargazin\"'s \"Born to ride/ Helplessly into a burning sky,\" and \"Mourning of the Earth\"'s \"Roman candles in the sky.\" There's also self-mutilation (\"I bled for you, come now and bleed for me, too/ Then stitch me up again\"), burial (\"Spread my remains close by where the weeping willow stood/ I'll be born again\"), and plenty of general pain and failure. But it's not melancholic or dour. It's the restlessness of a song like \"Thunder Road\". It's the end of the world in Jane's Addiction's \"Stop\". This is angst you can sing along to while drinking beers in the backyard with your friends.There's also a punk attitude here. On the radio-hit-in-another-universe title-track, Shi shouts: \"Got a long list of foes and a shorter list of friends.\" You get the feeling that this isn't entirely true-- ASG are a likable band who've been around a long time-- but it does feel right in this music, where the emotion is a large part of the appeal. And on \"Blues for Bama\", he sings \"comes as you were\" in a lower, scruffier register before singing it again closer to his usual tone. It's a nice nod to Nirvana, and also entirely fitting: Like Nirvana, this is a rock band that can make us dance to songs about \"a lifetime of shit and disfigurement.\"\n",

      "I remember reading a desert-island-albums list by Billy Corgan in 1993 that was so scarily like my own musical arc-- pop/prog/metal nerd discovers goth, Jane's Addiction, and My Bloody Valentine-- that I couldn't have been more designed for Smashing Pumpkins hyperfandom if I tried. Like no one before him, Corgan made those influences work. As Canadian writer Jennifer Nine once put it in Melody Maker, you got a sense that he was the kind of guy who worked out every last transcription from Guitar Player in the 1980s and then actually did something with it. It helped that the rest of the band had their own skills, especially in the case of Jimmy Chamberlin, a jazz/hard-rock drum freak let loose on alt-rock radio.Alt-rock radio, at its height of commercial trendsetting, enabled the Pumpkins to not merely survive but thrive. There, Corgan could have his cake and eat it too, daring people to get annoyed at his starlust and reacting in kind while further building up his ambitions. He got his band signed to a major label and used the fig leaf of a corporate indie release for Gish, scored a prime spot on the Seattle-focused Singles soundtrack with \"Drown\", essentially went \"Haters gonna hate\" with Siamese Dream's first single \"Cherub Rock\", and got petulant when any other acts or writers accused him of protesting too much. And not just Pavement, either: \"You hurt me deeply in my heart,\" he once infamously pouted to Kim Thayil before a 1994 Australian concert, following which the Pumpkins went on \"to play the best set anybody has ever heard them play.\"All of which goes some distance toward explaining why both reissues of Gish and Siamese Dream-- appropriately loaded with rarities, DVD bonuses, fancy packaging, and often-impressionistic song-for-song liner notes by Corgan-- remain remarkable though unequal listens. Even in 1991, Gish felt like something that started off well with songs like \"Siva\" and \"Rhinoceros\" but meandered a bit toward the end. Corgan's voice never sounded as lost in his music as it does here, and most of the emphasis is on the band's collective performance: Chamberlin's powerful, fluid drumming, Darcy Wretzky's strong basslines, and that thick, chunky glaze of guitars.The rarities disc contains a few never-before-heard numbers, a few that have long circulated among fanatics (the Corgan-sung version of \"Daydream\" is a keeper), and a handful of remixed selections (including their best full-on rock epic, \"Starla\") that first surfaced on a full-length release via the odds-and-ends release Pisces Iscariot. These tracks do a better job of showcasing the band's various sonic sides than Gish itself. The DVD, a multi-camera cut from a live show at the Metro in Chicago almost a year prior to Gish's release, shows that the band already had their exact arrangements pretty well down, as well as a worshipping fanbase. The highlights include Corgan and James Iha's heavily long hair, curious fashion choices all around, and set-closing covers of Steppenwolf and Blue Öyster Cult; the video quality is pretty good and the sound mix, if heavily favoring the vocals, beats out most bootlegs of the time.In contrast to Gish's steady flow, Siamese Dream crashes out of the gate. \"Cherub Rock\" remains an absolutely stellar opener with a sense of pure sonic melodrama, thanks to Chamberlin's circus-act drum introduction, a tight clip of guitars quickly matched by equally nimble bass, a volcanic blast of a guitar lead, and then a shift to a woozy, still-building sprawl. And all this before the first verse even starts. Throw in everything that followed-- the overt MBV worship of \"Hummer\", the country-rock-tinged wanderlust of \"Mayonaise\", \"Soma\"'s update of Prince's \"The Beautiful Ones\" for a new decade, and inevitably the MTV/radio hits \"Today\", \"Disarm\", and \"Rocket\"-- and no matter your take on its mastermind or his divisive whining/sighing vocals, it's an embarrassment of musical riches.There's also the fact that the album's studio personnel was as essentially stripped down as the White Stripes; Corgan, frantically taking charge in the midst of band dysfunction, recorded nearly everything himself aside from the drums, and he'd probably have handled those too if he could. Siamese Dream's songs don't blend into each other, but some transitions exist; each stands out in a brilliant sequence, forming perhaps the best concept album they ever made.One of the main things people complained about was exactly what made the band click even further. If Corgan's early lyrics were classic self-centered/self-righteous/self-pitying teenagerdom run amock, he always had an ear for hooks, metaphors, and deft summaries (thus, on \"Mayonaise\": \"Fool enough to almost be it/ Cool enough to not quite see it\"). It's catnip for when you have it bad, no matter how minuscule your problems might really be, and any number of later bands (My Chemical Romance most obviously, and the Pains of Being Pure at Heart most recently) took plenty of notice.As for the many rarities, more Pisces Iscariot remixes and other demos and alternate versions take a bow, including a six-minute version of \"Siamese Dream\" itself (the original B-side version was a shorter and murkier take that ran under three minutes) and twin instrumentals \"U.S.A.\" and \"U.S.S.R.\". The DVD is the most worthwhile addition of either reissue; taken from another Metro show a couple of weeks after Siamese Dream's release, it vividly illustrates how far the band had come in the three years since Gish: It showcases their more varied sound, Corgan's keener sense for playing to the crowd (there are flashes of his and Iha's underrated sense of humor), a killer setlist drawing on both albums (plus \"Starla\" and \"Drown\"), and brilliant sound and performances throughout. If Corgan's voice shows strain at many points, the crowd shots are especially entertaining, with endless moshpits and crowdsurfers during most of the loud points and plenty of the slow ones.The full story of the band's existence has plenty of ups and downs to go through, and there are more reissues to come to spell this out, even as the current version of the band moves along according to Corgan's own cryptic impulses.

      "The year 1991 was a significant one in Jane's Addiction lore, marking both the launch of the L.A. art-rockers' Lollapalooza travelling-circus experiment and the announcement of the band's dissolution. Now, on the 20th anniversary of those events, both brands are still making headlines, despite enduring extended periods of inactivity, aborted restarts, and organizational restructuring. And it's perhaps no coincidence that both Jane's Addiction and Lollapalooza have evolved in exactly the same way: What were once unpredictable, chaotic forces have inevitably mutated into well-oiled, monolithic entities bearing little of the charm and character of their original incarnations. This circumstance is not lost on frontman/Lolla visionary Perry Farrell who, on Jane's Addiction's new album, proudly declares, \"We've become a big business/ A galaxy merger!\"Even if that line is intended to be a metaphor for a blossoming romantic relationship, the fact that Farrell's singing of love in the language of commerce effectively sums up the proficient but perfunctory nature of The Great Escape Artist, Jane's Addiction's fifth official album, their second comeback record (following 2003's Strays), and the first release since the short-lived reintroduction of founding bassist Eric Avery into the fold for a 2009 tour. No doubt, their various attempts to keep Jane's alive over the past decade have taught Farrell, guitarist Dave Navarro, and drummer Stephen Perkins that replacing Avery requires more than just finding a talented bass player. In many respects, Avery defined the band's sonic identity and mystique; think of any Jane's classic, and often the first thing that pops into your head is one of those ominous, propulsive basslines. So while the middling Strays tried to plug session vet Chris Chaney into the dynamic, for The Great Escape Artist, the band makes a more concerted effort at revitalization, recruiting everyone from TV on the Radio's Dave Sitek to Guns N' Roses bassist Duff McKagan to Morocco's Master Musicians of Joujouka-- a trifecta of collaborators who respectively play to Jane's Addiction's affinities for heady atmosphere, raunchy hard rock, and tribal-percussion jams.At the outset, The Great Escape Artist lives up to that on-paper potential: Farrell's freak-scene re-indoctrination \"Underground\" and Avery-directed invective \"End to the Lies\" (featuring the Joujouka crew) open the album with a pair of promisingly authoritative metallic grinds that sound like they were grafted from the slow-motion mid-section of Ritual de lo Habitual's \"Stop\", but with Sitek's chrome-plated textures adding a post-apocalyptic ambience that greatly complements Navarro's eerie six-string squeals. But there's a palpable dip in intensity from there on in, as The Great Escape Artist gets mired in the not-quite-rock/not-quite-ballad purgatory that defines so much post-grunge alt-radio.As slickly produced as Nothing's Shocking and Ritual de lo Habitual were, you always got the sense that Jane's Addiction were a band of four interconnected personalities contributing distinct, individual parts to the majestic whole. But even compared to the nu-metalloid sheen of Strays, The Great Escape Artist's intricate, heavily lacquered production-- courtesy of Muse-man Rich Costey-- has the effect of making Jane's Addiction sound like an anonymous assemblage of oversaturated recording tracks. More so than Avery's commanding presence, what's really missing here is Jane's Addiction's sense of playfulness, absurdity, and rhythmic verve. Beyond hard-charging closer \"Words Right Out of My Mouth\", powerhouse drummer Perkins is given scant opportunity to flex his percussive muscle and is instead relegated to playing the mild-mannered time-keeper on melodramatic turns like \"Twisted Tales\" and \"Splash a Little Water on It\", while Sitek's bass contributions are barely perceptible underneath the glossy sheen. And for a frontman who's always been happy to flaunt his own ridiculousness, Farrell is surprisingly humorless here, the quirky character studies and brash swagger of old replaced by straight-faced pleading and vague second-person admonishments. Sure, the line, \"You were the foreskin/ I was the real head,\" reads as hilarious but, coming from a Jew, probably isn't meant as a term of endearment.There is, however, one song here-- \"Broken People\"-- that cuts through The Great Escape Artist's sleek surface and provides a glimpse of the charismatic, affective band that Jane's once were and still could be. (Surprisingly, it's one of McKagan's three co-writes.) And, as per the standard set by \"I Would For You\", \"Jane Says\", and \"Then She Did...\", \"Broken People\" is a melancholic reverie dedicated to a tragic female protagonist, though instead calling upon his usual cast of junkies and eccentrics, Farrell updates the archetype to paint a sympathetic portrait of a sex-vid-shilling celebutante. Despite the sensationalistic subject matter, Jane's treat it with an understated elegance, thanks to Navarro's beautifully restrained guitar line, a sensitive but not mawkish vocal from Farrell, and-- rare for this album-- a concise, unfussy arrangement; even the amped-up, fist-pump treatment applied to the third verse can't sully the song's graceful sway. In a world where truly nothing is shocking, Jane's Addiction have understandably lost the will and desire to be as outrageous and confrontational as they once were. But as \"Broken People\" attests, the most effective way for a big business to surprise you is through a simple, humble act of charity.\n",

      "On paper, TV on the Radio's recent accomplishments look like the work of textbook careerists. They left renowned indie label Touch and Go to join Interscope. Their major-label debut boasted a cameo from David Bowie. Singer Tunde Adebimpe starred opposite Anne Hathaway in a Jonathan Demme-directed drama. Guitarist/producer Dave Sitek made a record with Scarlett Johansson and is now possibly joining Jane's Addiction. Of course, one listen to any TV on the Radio album quickly dispels any notion of calculated opportunism. Even as their art-rock soul has blossomed out of their home-recording roots into something bigger and bolder, their music is still fraught with a simmering unease; even the dancefloor-ready maneuvers of 2008's Dear Science exuded a jittery, restless energy that was as tense as it was celebratory.However, as Nine Types of Light suggests, perhaps they just needed to get out of Brooklyn. The new album marks two significant changes in TVOTR's methodology: It was made in the wake of a one-year hiatus following six years of non-stop recording and touring; and it was recorded in Los Angeles, where Sitek has been steadily building his celebrity clientele list over the past few years. Both factors seem to have influenced the sound and feel of the album: Nine Types of Light is unquestionably TV on the Radio's most patient, positive recording to date, taking its cues as much from Dear Science's serene ballads (\"Family Tree\", \"Love Dog\") as its brassy workouts. Each of the band's albums has opted for a tone-setting opening salvo, and mission statements don't come more concise and clear-headed than Tunde Adebimpe's ecstatic, falsettoed hook on Nine Types' first song, \"Second Song\": \"Every lover on a mission/ Shift your known position/ Into the light.\"Love songs are, of course, nothing new for TV on the Radio, but they're usually cast against the grim backdrop of life during wartime: Desperate Youth, Bloodthirsty Babes' doo-wop serenade \"Ambulance\" spoke of emotional commitment using the language of hospital care; Return to Cookie Mountain's \"Province\" effectively equated a declaration of love with an act of radicalism. On Nine Types of Light, however, there seems to be a more concerted effort on the band's part to not let external pressures sully their inner spirit: Set to steady shuffle beats, \"Will Do\" and \"You\" are impassioned, open-hearted addresses delivered free of any political context, while Kyp Malone's \"Keep Your Heart\" feels like a riposte to Cookie Mountain's defeatist \"I was a lover before this war\" refrain, promising instead to \"keep your heart, if the world all falls apart.\" Malone's stutter-funk standout \"No Future Shock\" takes this don't-let-the-bastards-get-you-down sentiment to more delightfully absurd extremes, channeling pervasive anxieties over everything from global economic collapse to invasive airport security into a new dance move (\"Do the no future! Do the no future!\").Coming four songs in, \"No Future Shock\" at first feels like an anomaly on an album that frontloads its more elegiac material; the notion that Nine Types is a more subdued, comedown counterpoint to Dear Science is further posited by Adebimpe's six-minute, mid-album centerpiece, \"Killer Crane\", a pretty, proggy pastorale that gently ebbs and flows with flourishes of strings, piano, banjo, and mellotron. But the album's second half is more in step with Dear Science's manic swagger; though mid-tempo exercises \"New Cannonball Blues\" and \"Forgotten\" never catch fire to the same degree (even with the late-song intrusion of the horn section), \"Repetition\" is an exhilarating display of Adibempe and Malone's motor-mouthed repartee set to a krautrock thrust. And as weird as it was to see Liars' Angus Andrew faithfully singing INXS' \"Guns in the Sky\" in a promo vid for Beck's Record Club last year, Nine Types' massive, arena-rattling closer, \"Caffeinated Consciousness\" proves that song must hold a special place in the hearts of Brooklyn's post-punk class of 2002.In the past, TV on the Radio have tried to undercut their more rockist ambitions with dissonant textures and queasy atmospherics, or lace their prettiest ballads with subversively ominous lyrics. But Nine Types of Light shows how TV on the Radio's transmissions can be just as effective and affecting when delivered free of static and noise.\n",

      "While it may seem as if there's not a new release without a hyphenated genre to give it birth, Bear in Heaven's second LP feels fresh simply because it resists easy categorization or comparison. This isn't to say it's sonically groundbreaking, though-- fitting for an album whose title references the four main navigational directions, Beast Rest Forth Mouth is as familiar-feeling as it is difficult to pinpoint. Mostly made up of textural, spacious three- to four-minute pop anthems with towering choruses, BRFM is a welcome reminder that an album doesn't have to be bombastic to feel huge and important. Take out the earbuds and let it fill a space: This is music that's bigger than your iPod-- music you'll want to feel all around you.Though not quite coming out of nowhere, BRFM seems like a surprise gift-- a striking consolidation of the spiky psych-prog tendencies of their debut into a pop framework. In terms of career gear-shifts, the move Caribou made with Andorra is the most recent precedent. Though at 41 minutes the album is economical and sharp in its execution, the band-- all from Georgia and Alabama-- still imbues its compositions with the generosity of spirit that makes the best Southern rock so invigorating. \"Beast in Peace\" opens the record with a gentle lockstep before shifting seamlessly into a mile-wide chorus. Then, they expand that chorus even further, like switching to the widest camera lens to capture a vista they just realized the full vastness of. Elsewhere, as its title indicates, \"Ultimate Satisfaction\" is an IMAX-wide ode to what starts out as a simple thought, then turns bodily-- the refrain of \"coming down!\" charts the sensation spreading like a spasm. That towering exultation is also felt on the primal \"Deafening Love\". While aiming for a similar sense of awe-inspiring bliss, \"Love\" widens the focus and luxuriates in the tremors, approximating a more protracted take on Jane's Addiction's \"Mountain Song\".Yet Bear in Heaven's greatest trick is creating music that evokes the sort of physicality and scope that could soundtrack a Hollywood film, but also works equally well at stirring up intimate bodily passion. Lush synth beds, warm electronics accenting polyrhythms, and Jon Philpot's yearning, boyish howl coalesce into a vibe that's muscular without being macho, and which strikes a rare balance between nuanced emotion and overwhelming sensation. Even when delving into more disconcerting subject matter-- dabbling in self-loathing on \"Wholehearted Mess\" or confronting paranoia on the slinky \"You Do You\"-- Philpot still manages to imbue the songs with an atmosphere of seduction and intrigue.An album like BRFM couldn't exist without a paean to the most severe and high-stakes of endeavors, and first single \"Lovesick Teenagers\" more than meets the requirements for 2009's Epic Song About Tortured Young Romance. With briskly alternating synth chords spitting by like fast-moving highway stripes, the titular couple are doomed to crash, but most likely in a JG Ballard sort of way. The pair martyr themselves in order to eternalize their passion, and the band is generous enough to resurrect them later, in the reprise of \"Teenagers\" that closes the album, seamlessly and surprisingly emerging from \"Casual Goodbye\". As a gesture, it's a slight nod backwards to the suite-like structures of their debut, but moreoever a celebration of abundance that wraps up an album overflowing with feeling. It's also an exclamation point signaling that Bear in Heaven not only clearly recognize their own best instincts, they're not shy about dwelling on them. Sure, bands can adapt to the current musical climate by adding extras to LPs, tweaking release dates to accommodate fan interest, or even giving away their music free. A curtain call like \"Teenagers\", though: now that's generosity.\n",

      "One of the reasons people are so fascinated by husband-and-wife bands (or former-husband-and-wife bands) is that we hope that the elusive magic that keeps people together or the visceral drama that tears them apart is audible somewhere in their three-minute pop nuggets. We're hoping to be a fly on the wall of their indie rock domicile. And though those sorts of bands-- from Yo La Tengo and Low to the White Stripes and Quasi-- release wonderful music, we are rarely given an actual glimpse into the intimacy of the relationship that crafted it. Viva Voce, a Portland-via-Alabama spousal duo, is one such group.On their four previous records, Viva Voce gave us stomping stoner anthems and warmly jangling pop, all crafted with an incisive eye for melodic detail. But on their latest offering, Kevin and Anita Robinson have not only pared things down, writing and recording everything for Rose City in less than a month, but built things up as well, adding two additional members to flesh out their lineup. The result is a fresh-sounding collection that feels easy and unpretentious yet urgent, an album that is markedly different from its heavier 2006 predecessor, Get Yr Blood Sucked Out, but one that continues its organic, imaginative bent. And though its songs may not explicitly deal with life in the Robinson's marriage (sadly, there's no hit single called \"Honey, Take Out the Trash\"), they definitely give voyeuristic listeners the feeling of a couple letting two new people into their insular world and offer songs that pulse with the immediacy of their off-the-cuff creation.The album opens with a surprising wallop of 1990s alt.radio rockness, as the glammy chug and reverberating riffs of \"Devotion\" call to mind both the slick pop aggression of Garbage and the theatrical guitar bravado of Jane's Addiction. It's strange to hear Viva Voce trying on a guise that is, at once, so straightforwardly rock (without any psychedelic or countrified influences) and polished to such glossy sheen. But lest you think the entire album is going to wallow in 90s nostalgia, the collection hits its stride on third track \"Octavio\", when it slows down to revel less in manic guitar pomp and more in Kevin's playful rhythms and Anita's dreamy vocals.Here, the key to Viva Voce's success-- long assumed to be Anita's guitar prowess and the interplay between the percussive husband and his melodic wife-- is her gilded coo. She has a limber voice that can wring the same sort of girlish, sassy flirtation from its cords as Jenny Lewis or Emily Haines, yet it's also adept at the sort of airy, hushed lilt that makes Chan Marshall and Feist so captivating. And given the space it deserves, her gently ethereal voice can become a track's guiding instrument, either when harmonizing with herself (as on \"Good as Gold\") or melting over the casual, deep-voiced delivery of her spouse (as on \"Midnight Sun\", the spacey, 1960s-tinged track that features the loveliest guitar melody of the entire collection).The Robinson's country-ish work as Blue Giant, another of the duo's musical projects, has obviously crept into their songwriting subconscious, coloring the western soundtrack guitars of \"Red Letter Day\" and the dusty cowpoke vibe of the surf guitars on \"Flora\". But Viva Voce smartly use such rustic touches just as flavoring, never straying too far from their gauzy rock roots. So though twangy electric guitar flourishes lurk under the warm piano vamp of \"The Slow Fade\", its repetitive descending melody-- which actually recalls an unplugged version of Nirvana's \"In Bloom\"-- makes it feel more like a rock'n'roll torch song than a rootsy barnburner.Rose City, an album named for the band's adopted hometown (featuring a title track on which a homesick Anita longs for the rain and glut of bands \"in the town I love\") and recorded in the Robinson's new home studio, is the epitome of \"homemade.\" And that's a good thing. Created in mere weeks, it doesn't sound fussy or fussed over, and manages the tricky balance of audible intimacy without crappy bedroom acoustics. So for anyone curious about what goes on chez Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, the answer is clear: lots of music making.\n",

      "Every great rock band has its quiet conscience, the in-house bullshit detector who keeps the band grounded while the egos and bank balances get too inflated, or who knows when to let things be once the thrill is gone. Perhaps not coincidentally, these people are invariably bassists: John Paul Jones in Led Zeppelin, Bill Wyman in the Rolling Stones and, in the case of Jane's Addiction, Eric Avery, who-- not wishing to tarnish the band's trailblazing 1987-1991 legacy-- opted out of lucrative reunion tours in 1997 and 2001. Perry Farrell may have gotten all the \"Alternative Nation\"–spokesman plaudits, Stephen Perkins may have gotten all the Modern Drummer covers, and Dave Navarro may have gotten all the Carmen Electra, but Avery was the band's pulse. His brooding, PiL-popping basslines provided the ominous undercurrent that gave depth to the band's glam-metal veneeer. Take him out of the equation, and Jane's veer dangerously close to becoming just another flashy L.A. rock band-- a point driven home by 2003's Avery-less reunion album, Strays, which, fittingly, is survived only by its Aerosmithy single \"Superhero\" becoming the opening theme to flashy L.A. TV show \"Entourage\".Avery's surprising re-entry into the Jane's fold last year is therefore significant-- so much so, it warrants a box-set celebration. The 4xCD A Cabinet of Curiosities-- two CDs of demos/rarities from 1986-91, a third featuring a 1990 live-show recording, and a DVD of assorted video ephemera-- could've theoretically been released at any point in the past 18 years, but the bassist's return provides the band with a somewhat justifiable reason to cash in now, honey. And what a lovely piece of furniture it is: A Cabinet of Curiosities arrives in a wooden, latched-door case, which opens up into a shrine-like assemblage of album and poster art, a thick booklet featuring testimonials from fans like Slash, Flea, and Billy Corgan, plus tarot cards and miniature worry dolls for each member. Leave it to Jane's Addiction-- a band who, at the height of 80s hair-metal, revitalized such hoary, unfashionable devices as goth, funk, proggy dinosaur-rock, and drum circles-- to raise the standard for CD box sets just as the medium is about to die.Unfortunately, all that elaborate packaging can't mask the fact there aren't very many curiosities to uncover here. As previous odds'n'sods collections Live and Rare and Kettle Whistle attested, Jane's didn't leave many leftovers behind; of the 29 outtakes compiled on Cabinet's first two discs, only four are originals that didn't feature on the band's first three albums, and three of those (the psych reverie \"Kettle Whistle\", the Stonesy folk ditty \"City\", and Farrell's woefully silly tribute to his cat, \"Maceo\") were already unveiled on Kettle Whistle, makinging an embryonic version of future Strays track \"Suffer Some\" (elements of which would be repurposed into \"No One's Leaving\") the lone revelation.The real lure, then, should be a handsome batch of previously unreleased demos that would form the foundation for 1987's self-titled live-album debut and 1988's breakthrough Nothing's Shocking. However, for all the tales of druggy decadence that surrounded their early years, Jane's showed up in the studio with their shit pretty much together, which means there's little mercurial mystique to be heard in early rips through \"Had a Dad\" and \"Pigs in Zen\". The purpose may be to showcase Jane's in their most primal state; however, unlike most products of the 1980s punk underground, Jane's were never built for lo-fi-- they demanded a wide-screened sound as big as the mountains and oceans Farrell sang about. And hearing Farrell strain his voice on \"Jane Says\", you realize how much of his androgynous charisma owed to the multi-tracked vocal effects favored by producer Dave Jerden. The most notable thing about the demos aren't the performances so much as the recording dates: Even as far back as 1987, Jane's had already mapped out the multi-sectional intricacies of \"Stop!\" and \"Three Days\", three years before they would surface on 1990's Ritual de lo Habitual.The rest of Cabinet's first two discs  is filled out with covers that cheekily acknowledge the band's internal hippie/punk contradictions, particularly on \"Bobhaus\" (Dylan's \"Like a Rolling Stone\" set to Bauhaus' \"Burning From the Inside\") and \"L.A. Medley\", a blitzkrieged blast through the Doors' \"L.A. Woman\", the Germs' \"Lexicon Devil\", and X's \"Nausea\" (though, 18 years after the track first appeared on the \"Classic Girl\" single, its components are still listed in the wrong order). Concert recordings of Led Zeppelin's \"Whole Lotta Love\" and the Stooges' \"1970\" don't transcend garage-band trashiness; by contrast, Jane's Addiction have never sounded more blissful and beautiful than on their tribute-album transformation of the Grateful Dead's \"Ripple\", which grafts the original's campfire melody onto a rolling jungle-rumble groove and practically invents Animal Collective 10 years early.A showdown between Farrell and Ice-T on Sly Stone's \"Don't Call Me Nigger, Whitey\" is more leadfooted, but, in retrospect, it serves a prescient soundtrack to an L.A. whose simmering racial tensions were about to explode into riots. The set's third disc-- a complete concert recorded at the Hollywood Palladium in December 1990-- provides an even more vivid sense of time and place. If the preceding demos and cover versions mostly deconstruct the Jane's myth, this live set reasserts their majesty, with thundering versions of \"Three Days\" and \"Ocean Size\" that evoke that scary/ecstatic feeling of losing your footing in the mosh pit and getting swept up in the tide.The Palladium performance of \"Ain't No Right\"-- the one followed by Farrell's rant about Birkenstocks-- is presented in visual form on Cabinet's fourth disc, which charts Jane's evolution through their videos, short films, and concert footage. While Nirvana's Nevermind is often credited with wiping hair-metal off the charts in one fell swoop, Jane's catalogue of videos shows them mobilizing the masses away from 80s Sunset Strip sleaze to the 90s alt-rock uprising. Like so many California rock bands of its time, Jane's Addiction filled their videos with images of the Hollywood Hills, surfing, pool parties,  and (when network censors permitted them) naked chicks. But their aesthetic remove from the L.A. scene is best exemplified by the 1989 hodgepodge short-film Soul Kiss, reproduced here from a VHS copy and comprised of candid shots of Avery discussing his toilet reading while taking a dump; Navarro providing a \"Cribs\"-like tour of his squalid apartment (anticipating his future as reality-TV show huckster); and everyone in the band making out with each other.However, Cabinet is lacking one crucial video curio: Gift, Farrell's feature-length, fictionalized account of his heroin-fuelled romance with then-girlfriend Casey Niccoli. History, of course, would show Farrell to be more adept at staging musical festivals than making films; Gift is a mess, its central narrative concerning the Niccoli character's OD routinely upended by tangential Jane's concert footage (including the aforementioned \"Ain't No Right\" clip) and other episodic silliness. But at the time of its 1993 release, Gift was a suitably absurd epitaph to an absurd band whose excesses initially got the better of them. For a box set that indulges die-hard fandom as eagerly as this one, A Cabinet of Curiosities feels a little barren without it. Or maybe they're just saving the reissue for the next reunion tour.\n",

      "Wyllt, Black Math Horseman's debut, is a fascinating compendium of the last 30 years of rock. Many bands are retro-aware-- see Bigelf, as well as most of Black Math Horseman's labelmates on Tee Pee-- but few embody the past yet avoid merely wearing its clothes. Retro awareness usually involves blinders to the present, which Black Math Horseman do not wear. One school of thought says that everything that can be done has been done. If so, Black Math Horseman have sharp filters. They've funneled the best parts of rock's giants into a richly idiosyncratic entity.Black Math Horseman = Led Zeppelin's bombast + Black Sabbath's rhythm section + 1970s psych rock dilation + Isis' minimal-maximal dynamics. This is a horrible description, I know. But when listening to Wyllt, it's impossible not to hear decades of record collecting riffling by. Parts of \"Deerslayer\", for example, could have been on Badmotorfinger (Soundgarden chaneling Sabbath), Ritual de lo Habitual (Jane's Addiction channeling Zeppelin), and, of all things, She Hangs Brightly. Sera Timms' mostly cool-tempered voice suggests Nico on 4AD, complete with ghostly reverb. The gauzy \"Torment of the Metals\" recasts the Doors' \"The End\" as Krautrock. But though this record was raised on radio, no cuts are obvious singles, especially with Timms haunting the back of the mix. A college party soundtrack this is not.For all the references this record evokes, it feels elusive. The band seems like it's working from deep within its influences. Songs are layered yet minimal. No jam sections here-- every note is in its place. The result is a studied diligence that's appealingly austere, yet frustratingly restrained. Black Math Horseman have potent ingredients, but they cook them at a simmer. That makes Wyllt a smooth listen, but it rarely boils over. Most attempts to do so merely raise bubbles.The one exception is \"Bird of All Faiths and None/Bell from Madrone\". This 11-minute behemoth closes the record with a vocal performance on par with early PJ Harvey. Timms cuts through her reverb, sonorously elongating syllables, bending blue notes to the hilt, and howling with feral abandon. Janis Joplin would approve. Here, Black Math Horseman access the dark mojo of Black Sabbath; Timms accesses pure animality. More like this, please. Classic rock was scary once; Black Math Horseman could make it scary again.\n",

      "While a number of bands have aped Led Zeppelin's \"flamboyant frontman + hotshot guitarist\" shtick-- Jane's Addiction, Whitesnake, basically all of hair metal-- few capture their breadth like Wetnurse. Invisible City, the New Yorkers' second full-length, reinvents Led Zeppelin as a punk band. Drummer Curran Reynolds doesn't hit as hard as John Bonham, but he has a similar knack for groove and beat selection. Cleave Jimmy Page's double-necked axe in two, and you get guitarists Garett Bussanick and Greg Kramer. Shave Robert Plant's head, firm up his abs, and make him a black man: Gene Fowler. Then, mix in 1990s noise rock-- Fowler's yelp is a lot like David Yow's-- and the outré dissonance of early Voivod.\n",
      " \n",
      "But the similarities are not only cosmetic. Like Zeppelin, Wetnurse are fond of acoustic guitar. Invisible City opens and closes with acoustic picking, and \"Life at Stake\" has strumming straight out of Led Zeppelin III. But, unlike Led Zeppelin, these acoustic bits aren't full songs. They're Wes Anderson-esque interludes that help underscore just how weird this record is. From the unbecoming name to the curiously bland artwork to the almost complete omission of printed lyrics, it's hard to penetrate Wetnurse.\n",
      " \n",
      "Yet their twists and turns invariably lead to anthemic climaxes that, again, recall Zeppelin. \"Life at Stake\" deliciously pits major-key licks against minor-key riffs; the pull-offs of the former are pure \"Over the Hills and Far Away\". The descending chords in \"Sacred Peel\" recast \"Kashmir\" as proggy metalcore. Dinosaur rock also crops up in \"Slow Your Spell, Miss Hell\", albeit under the glowing arc lights of Chavez. Other memorable surprises include the Helmet riff snuck into \"Not Your Choice\" and the startlingly operatic diva that crowns \"Missing Lion Returns\".\n",
      " \n",
      "Such unpredictability is both titillating and tiring. Wetnurse have an endless supply of catchy riffs, but they deploy them all instead of letting any sink in. Martin Bisi's recording feels dull; the guitars roar, but the drums merely punch where they should crack. Wetnurse's off-kilter attack works better live. There, their rapid-fire succession of riffs feels like fireworks at close range. They're punk, they're metal, they're classic rock; they're the \"all of the above\" that makes New York City frustratingly wonderful.\n",

      "A brief series of birdcalls open Pterodactyl's self-titled debut. The misty chirps don't evoke the prehistoric lizard after which the Brooklyn-via-Ohio band named themselves-- more like the tiny creatures that wake you early on weekends. Regardless of who owns the peeps, it's a fitting 11 seconds, because even when Pterodactyl pushes for fury, a melodic sweetness and nerdy fragility hover within the trio's chiming guitars and cymbal crashes: These birds cackle, giggle, brim with sugar-coated spastics.Folks use \"Brooklyn noise-rock\" to describe things that aren't so noisy, and maybe not even from Brooklyn. This particular not-so-noisy Brooklyn band is often linked to labelmates Parts & Labor. First the practical reasons for the pairing: two thirds of P&L released Pterodactyl's last 7-inch, along with the vinyl version of this one, on their Cardboard label. You could connect dots musically, but it's more telling to jot differences: drummer Matt Marlin goes easier on his equipment than P&L's Christopher R. Weingarten; Pterodactyl's harmonies aren't as sonically or psychedelically deep; P&L is a longer-running crew, able to draw from a bigger aesthetic/experiential bag of licks.Pterodactyl can be raw, goofy, or upfront. The album's most compelling tracks, though, sport a high level of sampler-amped sumptuousness; they find a way to loop and rotate without losing steam. \"Safe Like A Train\" turns Sonic Slinty sharps into merry-go-rounds layered with clipped nasal pop-boy song-birding; on \"Polio\", muscular, slaphappy drums and slippery guitars lap against high, airy Jane's Addiction vocals; \"Three Succeed\" pits loping Deerhoofed staccato with duct-taped harmonies that make perfect sense on a label run by Oneida. The rush of \"Ask Me Nicely\" is a pummeling, snotty punk blast.Not everything is such a triumph. \"Rampage, Pt. 1\", which introduces a mid-level pace and Modest Mouse-like sing-a-long, drags, though there's still something slinky about it. Also scattered throughout the program are a few too many micro-sound bits/bytes and instrumental fragments that, unlike the initial tweets, don't add much beyond padding... Not bad, but might as well cut to the chase.Thankfully, momentum's recovered torrentially on \"CHX. BX.\", a Lighting Bolt-speed rocker, and the stately, time-ticking closer \"Esses\", which finds the group experimenting successfully with a slow-arcing six-minute build of barber-shopped, Beach-Boyed pop. Where those tiny incidentals and mid-tempo songs drag, this expansion's an emphatic exclamation.As groups grow increasingly sophisticated in genre blending, they can reject simplicity en route to aesthetic expansiveness. Spread your wings bravely, cool-- but it doesn't always work. As 2001 as it sounds, sometimes it best suits a group when they forgo the fancy shit and just rock. Interestingly, \"Esses\" shows Pterodactyl are capable of opening it up incrementally-- something to look forward to in the future. For now, the youngsters' collection, one of my favorite surprises of 2007, more often than not hits best when it plows ahead like an out-of-control pickup truck.\n"

      "Power pop is easy to do, but difficult to do well. Guitar bands playing sorta catchy hooks at sorta fast tempos abound, most hewing closely to the same styles and structures. Occasionally you get a Cheap Trick, Big Star, Fight Songs-era Old 97s, or early-90s Matthew Sweet, artists who take to the form like a birthright. But they're usually the exceptions. So why do the Broken West, a five-piece hailing from Los Angeles, sound so distinctive even when they don't sound new or necessarily unique? Their influences are all immediately recognizable and their songs all hummably predictable, and yet their Merge debut, I Can't Go On, I'll Go On, reveals the band to be confidently inventive and assured in their collective identity (nevermind that they had to change the band name just months before the release of this album).I've been parsing this question ever since the review copy of I Can't Go On showed up on my doorstep late last year, and I finally found the answer when, out of sheer coincidence, I took a last-minute trip to Los Angeles, a place I've been fascinated with since reading Joan Didion's The White Album in college but had never managed to visit. On the return flight, as soon as I heard the chiming intro to \"On the Bubble\", I was transported right back to that Los Feliz apartment veranda, sipping a vodka and vitamin water, shooting the breeze with friends, and listening to the noise of the city as it sprawled in all directions around me. The strongest and most inviting aspect of I Can't Go On is its sense of place, effortlessly depicted but surprisingly specific. These songs evoke sunny skies, scrubbrush canyons, bad traffic, palm trees, and half-recognized minor celebrities.Rather than patterning themselves on one or two particular artists, the Broken West draw on past local scenes to strengthen those evocations without being obvious. The handclap hopscotch rhythms and bright guitar sound on \"Slow\" and the airy vocals and blocky keyboards on \"Shiftee\" recall the pop scene of the late 60s, while the songs like \"Abigail\" and \"Baby on My Arm\", with their strummy moods, evoke the Laurel Canyon scene of the 70s and the 80s Paisley Underground. And I swear I hear a little 80s Sunset Strip hair metal in some of the guitars, but I might be dreaming.Occasionally the Broken West root themselves too deeply in the city's past, and I Can't Go On threatens to become an exercise in historical re-creation. But that sense of being stuck in the past is never pervasive: Despite a few stumbles (the melody on \"Brass Ring\" never resolves itself satisfactorily, and closer \"Like a Light\" lacks the airtight structure of previous songs), the band transcends base nostalgia. They compensate for their somewhat geeky obsessiveness with confident songwriting, inventive arrangements, and verite production that emphasizes the band's breakneck live energy, especially on \"On the Bubble\" and \"Hale Sunrise\". Best of all is \"Down in the Valley\", resurrected from their equally strong EP The Dutchman's Gold, which they self-released in 2004 when the band was still know as the Brokedown. It's a solid four minutes of churning guitars, fizzy harmonies, and insanely catchy melodies, anchored by a chorus that simultaneously plays into the city's good-time vibe while slyly undercutting it: \"Sun down, blood horizon, now it feels all right/ No one feels the darkness down in the valley tonight.\"Despite their California origins, the Broken West aren't pioneers staking out new territory. Like L.A. County, the terrain has been well walked for years. And yet, I'd rather hang out in their familiar L.A. than in the Thrills' fantasy city, the Chili Peppers' rich-boy funk metropolis, or Jane's Addiction's romanticized junkie playground. And maybe they don't even represent the real L.A. past or present (and how could they with no Compton beats or Western swing?), but simply the L.A. of our collective imagination.\n",

      "A few months ago a friend lent me some old Spin magazines. December 1991, the annual \"Year in Music\" roundup, is a particularly edifying issue. Tucked away in the record review section is a 170-word quickie about a new album by Nirvana. Lauren Spencer gives Nevermind the green light (the only ratings then were green, yellow, and red) and says, \"I swear you'll be humming these songs for the rest of your life.\" A couple pages later is a lukewarm (yellow) review of a new My Bloody Valentine album called Loveless. Jim Greer is bummed that it doesn't sound more like Blood, Sweat & Tears. Oh well. In a \"Ten Best Albums of the Year You Didn't Hear\" sidebar, Spin extols the virtues of Pavement's Perfect Sound Forever EP and Royal Trux' Twin Infinitives. The \"Artist of the Year\" on the cover? Perry Farrell.One narrative for the decade, then, was pretty well laid out by December 1991. And Jane's Addiction were central to that story, even though, as Farrell discusses in the accompanying interview, they had just broken up. After that summer's Lollapalooza tour, the first, Jane's were no more. But it didn't matter then that they were supposedly finished, since they'd already set the tone for the next several years of youth culture. Greil Marcus argued that Bob Dylan invented the 1960s with \"Like a Rolling Stone\"; by similar logic, you could say that Jane's Addiction invented the 90s in the time between Nothing's Shocking and that first Lollapalooza.Jane's were proud to be alternative music icons, and Farrell had the dreadlocks to prove it. Though they were arty and just a little dangerous, Jane's were oddly accessible, which helped push the underground up into the sunlight. They sang about things like heroin and serial killers but seemed relatable somehow; whitebread Midwesterners could \"get\" them, no problem. Authenticity was never an issue with Perry Farrell. You knew he grew up a middle-class Jewish kid, that his father was a jeweler, and that, in the great tradition of rock music, he was able to reinvent himself completely as a chronicler of L.A.'s bohemian underbelly. He said \"motherfucker\" a lot, like he was some street dude, even though he was a child of privilege. His background didn't matter; what counted was who he wanted to be. Because of his influence, we had a nation of college kids with more beer money than sense serenading next-door neighbors with impromptu acoustic renditions of \"Jane Says\". (I wasn't the only one, was I?)And then there was the music, which brought several strands of 80s underground culture under a single tent. There was the scratchy wah-wah funk, the gothic undercurrent of Eric A's bass-- lines for the ages, truly, and there will never be a Jane's without him-- and Dave Navarro's guitar, which was both \"heavy\" in the metal sense but always ready to lose the weight and drift off into a psychedelic space. Something for everybody who liked the music chronicled in Our Band Could Be Your Life, really; a canny musical blend from a very canny band.Jane's weren't finished in 1991, of course, and even then people probably suspected as much. The pull to see if something more can be salvaged-- and to make more money-- is strong, and Jane's reunited live periodically and returned with Strays in 2003. By then, the sound they helped create at the dawn of the 90s had become rock's standard expression, and they seemed content to blend in with the nu-metal multitudes. It's not a particularly good record. And so when I remember Jane's Addiction, I like to remember the one that broke up at the height of their powers in 1991, with two amazing studio albums and that initial live document to their names.Their brief initial run presents an immediate problem as far as compiling a best-of: why whittle two discs, which together add up to 96 minutes of music, to one? Filler on both Nothing's Shocking and Ritual de lo Habitual is almost non-existent, so if you're looking for an introduction to Jane's Addiction, why not just start with one of those? The answer provided by this track selection-- so that you can also get \"Superhero\" and \"Just Because\" from Strays, \"Whores\" from the live debut, and a \"Jane Says\" recorded on the first Lollapalooza tour and released previously on the vault-clearing Kettle Whistle-- doesn't wash. This best-of exists because important bands are supposed to have best-ofs.But still: \"Stop\", \"Ocean Size\", \"I Would for You\", \"Been Caught Stealing\", \"Summertime Rolls\", \"Mountain Song\", etc. Even \"Superhero\"-- or, as I like to call it, \"Rag Doll 2003\"-- isn't so bad, for a knockoff of late-period Aerosmith. But hearing \"Three Days\" and not having it followed by \"Then She Did\", well, it hurts a little. And as for the live \"Jane Says\", maybe everyone tired of the Nothing's Shocking version, I don't know. I never did. Matter of fact, I'm looking at that guitar in the corner that hasn't been tuned in five years and I remember how it goes-- just G and A, isn't it? But OK, the live version is decent, and it's a nice reminder that Jane's came so close to the best band breakup since the Beatles. No band since has been as far in front as they were in December 1991, and though this comp is unnecessary, it explains why.\n",

      "As many others have done this year, the other night I went to see the Pixies' reunion tour. Next week, the Nirvana box set is finally released, as is a new two-disc expanded version of Nine Inch Nails' The Downward Spiral; Low's upcoming Sub Pop record kicks off with a track whose rhythm section and vocal melody sound like a miniature version of Alice in Chains; Q magazine named The Red Hot Chili Peppers the Best Act in the World Today at its 2004 awards show; TV commercials for Green Day's American Idiot reminds us that 10 years ago they released Dookie; and now Pearl Jam are lionized with the two-disc, 33-track, best-of album, Rearviewmirror. I'd be frightened that we're about to undergo a full-blown 90s alternarock revival-- an era depressingly and backhandedly praised as much for what it was not (e.g. the hair metal that it \"kicked out,\" or the nu-metal that some of it slowly morphed into) than the music it produced. But then, it never went away, did it?In recent years, Billy Corgan's Zwan, a reunited Jane's Addiction, the Scott Weiland-fronted Velvet Revolver, and the Chris Cornell/Rage Against the Machine mashup Audioslave have released records to varying degrees of commercial success. Prior to that, the nascent sounds of grunge remained among the dominant North American hard rock templates throughout the 90s and into this decade, living on in a lineage that extended from its Seattle roots through Bush and Candlebox to Creed and Nickleback.Oddly, Pearl Jam have remained a constant since the days when 120 Minutes graduated to Alternative Nation, transitioning from stadium fillers to one of American rock's largest and most beloved cult bands, a Grateful Dead for the great washed. After deftly turning their backs on fame just as much of the public seemed poised to turn on them, Pearl Jam cultivated the unwavering support of a cabal of devotees who followed the band across a string of studio albums that casual observers have likely forgotten-- No Code, Yield, Binaural, and Riot Act-- and the almost comical release of every live show from their 2000 tour, a move that, depending on your level of cynicism, was either a thank you or an unintentional fuck you to their lemmingesque fanbase. Musically, Pearl Jam slightly spiced up their sound over the course of a decade, adding a few Eastern-tinged delicacies and some garage-rock snackfood to their typical meat-and-potatoes diet. By the time Creed became a permanent fixture on late-90s rock radio, the Florida band sounded as much like Pearl Jam as, well, Pearl Jam themselves.Rearviewmirror divides the band's career into an \"up side\" and a \"down side\"-- the former are the earnest rockers, the latter are the earnest ballads-- although the monikers would also have been appropriate had they arranged the record chronologically. The \"down side\" to Pearl Jam's career allowed many people to romanticize the group's shift away from the spotlight as one purely of choice, and the band has since been characterized by honesty, good intentions, and yeoman's work, the sort of qualities that often make for turgid, sometimes rote, faceless music.In truth, Pearl Jam were always planted squarely in the middle of the road. While Nirvana was characterized by punk's sound as much as its ethos, Soundgarden had one foot in contemporary metal, Smashing Pumpkins mixed 80s goth and new wave in with their glam, and Green Day, NIN, and the RHCP were clearly creatures of the post-punk era, Pearl Jam was always a classic rock band, the one alt-nation superstar that completely ignored both punk and its aftermath. Pearl Jam were all solos and riffs and lighters-aloft, arena-rock sentiment; like so many 60s rockers, they looked to the Asian sub-continent for their first flirtations with \"growth\" and \"maturity\"; they even cuddled up to the \"right\" rock 'n' roll architects (Pete Townshend, Bob Dylan, Neil Young). To claim Pearl Jam as the greatest rock band of our time-- as many listeners and critics do-- is virtually a negation of the past 30 years of guitar-based music, a relieved sigh that the values of the 70s aren't completely lost.And... that works for a lot of people. Pearl Jam struck chords within listeners like few of their contemporaries. Those diehards probably looked at the Rearviewmirror tracklist and chuckled, wondering why it didn't include this rarity or that B-side (it does have a few key ones, e.g. \"Yellow Ledbetter\") or a handful of what the album rock stations used to call \"deep cuts.\" This comp isn't for them, though; it's for the rest of us, and a lot of listeners will likely glance at it, wonder where the hell \"Crazy Mary\" is, and consider it a handy career-spanner-- all the Pearl Jam they'll ever need. If they buy it, those listeners will likely be surprised that-- despite some non-descript titles (\"Corduroy\", \"Go\", \"Immortality\", the title track)-- they remember most of these tracks, and despite slipping well below the radar, the band has, in many ways, improved over the years.The record seemingly begins the same way as their debut, Ten, but this version of \"Once\" (like \"Alive\" and \"Black\") has been slightly re-mixed by Brendan O'Brien. Hardly radical and barely noticeable, the new versions buff the shine from the originals, actually improving three of the band's better, more melodic early tracks. On the album's first disc, the band's years of popularity-- through third album Vitalogy-- are only highlighted by the Singles track \"State of Love and Trust\" and the forceful \"Not For You\".A lot of the other big guns are better left unremembered: The five-against-one mutterings of \"Animal\"; \"Evenflow\", \"Rearviewmirror\", and \"Go\" plod along, monuments to the appropriateness of the tag \"grunge\"; \"Spin the Black Circle\" is their first step toward the clumsy romanticism of bygone days; and \"Jeremy\" remains as painful as ever. Perhaps that last track is only truly powerful when coupled with images of Vedder's emotive pantomimes, hard-scrawled title cards that say things like \"the serpent was subtil [sic]\" and \"90210\", or a shirtless boy both wrapped in the American flag and standing in front of a wall of flames and crouching in the woods in front of an overblown photo of a teeth-baring fox...On the up side, the garage-esque \"Do the Evolution\" is either over-the-top fun or completely ridiculous, depending on whether or not you believe Pearl Jam actually possess a sense of humor (in this case, I think it's the former), and \"I Got Shit\" (formerly \"I Got ID\"), \"Save You\", and \"Hail, Hail\" have a few more shades than the gray of the band's grunge era.On the way down, things are also scattered. Like they do on the early rockers, Vedder's vocal diversions, tics, and lack of enunciation occasionally move from exaggerated emoting into self-parody (see, in particular, \"Given to Fly\"). His voice is still the band's hallmark sound-- a mealy-mouthed, gravely style that influenced a decade of really, really shitty music-- and it's still fun to impersonate; unfortunately, on pain-wracked attempts to convey more universal emotions (the glib \"Elderly Woman Behind a Counter in a Small Town\", the lyrical disaster \"Wishlist\", \"Better Man\", the awkward cover of \"Last Kiss\"), it's not very fun to listen to.Even when Eddie's opening his mouth, the tunes are often excruciatingly drab dirges-- \"Immortality\" and \"Nothingman\" are the biggest offenders. (Yet ironically, the most overtly dirge-like track-- the almost mantra-esque, Eastern-tinged \"Who You Are\"-- is one of the set's most effective.) Elsewhere, the patient \"Off He Goes\", \"Nothing As It Seems\", and \"Man of the Hour\" and the solipsistic \"I Am Mine\" all carry a more weathered, wise sense of self, and these tracks greatly upstage the more youthful and clumsy neo-emoisms of the band's better known songs-- in particular its ballads.In some ways, it makes sense that Pearl Jam are improving as they slip further from the gaze of contemporary listeners and into the neolithic caves of mid-70s classic rock. For all the harm it unwittingly did to rock radio-- and for as comical as it can be in its most unchecked moments-- Vedder's voice is powerful and can even be captivating. The more considered and time-tested tones it now carries fit the band's more subtle shading.In full ham-fisted stadium rock mode, Pearl Jam now oddly seem miles away from Nirvana, still the best of their one-time Seattle contemporaries. Instead, they're not-so-distant cousins to the denim brigade, the faceless 70s arena rockers who dutifully punched time clocks and produced no-nonsense, sometimes hook-filled rock. Today, Pearl Jam seems bruised, ever so slightly more adventurous, and, thanks to the devotion of their fans, they're afforded the chance to dress up as rock iconoclasts rather than take a slide toward VH1-ready adult contemporary balladry. It's like punk never happened.\n",

      "Every night when my pregnant wife falls to sleep, I lean over and strap a pair of headphones to her swollen belly and queue up hours of music to pipe gently into the womb where my unborn child gestates. The program changes every night: The Beatles for lessons on love, Led Zeppelin for truth, Merzbow for fortitude. But every Sunday at the time when MTV used to broadcast 120 Minutes, I throw in the kind of music collected on Rhino's Left of the Dial, for just one reason: to turn my child into an insufferable hipster.The music on this set influenced most everything Pitchfork slobbers on today. The mandate of Left of the Dial-- to showcase anything that fit on college radio in the 80s-- means you'll find everything from punk and post-punk to synth-pop and dream-pop; it features early indie rock in all of its shades of amateurish enthusiasm and substance abuse. It covers most of the bands namechecked during the post-punk resurgence-- from Gang of Four to Throbbing Gristle to Joy Division-- and demonstrates how Bad Brains, Minor Threat, and The Minutemen expanded the punk world while The Replacements, R.E.M. and Beat Happening laid the groundwork for indie rock and Sonic Youth, Pixies, and Jane's Addiction did the same for 1990s grunge and alternative. But that's not all: We also get the moody atmospherics of The Church, Echo & The Bunnymen, and The Cure, and the synth-pop stylings of Japan, Depeche Mode, and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. Left of the Dial even has goth. And industrial. And, um, Faith No More.The set's compilers settled on 82 bands, and their selections are comprehensive and sometimes surprising. You don't get Devo, but they pick a Wall of Voodoo song-- and it's not \"Mexican Radio\". Hüsker Dü is better remembered today for their Bob Mould-penned tracks, but it's Grant Hart's \"Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely\" that's included here. The box is not without dirges or drags-- I forgot that Bauhaus' \"Bela Lugosi's Dead\" was so damn long-- but the producers don't skimp on upbeat singles and jangly guitars. If Left of the Dial makes you nostalgic, it's more likely to evoke the weightlessness of youth than to cajole a lump in your throat.But you don't judge a compilation by its hits alone, and it doesn't take long to find the set's weakness: sequencing. Rhino may have the best licensing lawyers in the business, but the tracklist came straight from a committee. Left of the Dial sounds anonymously plotless, and the second disc is littered with awkward segues: Ultravox's \"Vienna\" chokes the momentum from The Pretenders' \"Message of Love\", and the murderous chorus on Sisters of Mercy's \"This Corrosion\" steamrollers poor old XTC. (And who ends a disc with \"Senses Working Overtime\", anyway?) What's worse, slogging through Ministry's \"Stigmata\" after The Smiths' effusive \"This Charming Man\" is like having your early morning sex shattered by a street cleaner roaring past your window.This kind of sequencing also destroys all sense of context. Normally, it's my job as a reviewer to lecture you about the history of The Dead Milkmen, or write a book report on The Jesus & Mary Chain, or at least explain how Bauhaus became Love and Rockets or Joy Division became New Order-- but there are too many stories crammed in here, and anyway, when \"Temptation\" comes on, all I think is, \"Wow, this is a really great song.\" The set could also describe the competing narratives of polished synthesizer bands and passion-trumps-practice guitars-- but that makes no sense either, as the two sides often stay as distant as rival cliques at the high school reunion. Without a guiding principal, the dud tracks sound even weaker: You suspect there was only one person in the room arguing viciously to include Lone Justice's \"Ways to Be Wicked\", The Rain Parade's \"I Look Around\", or Faith No More's \"We Care a Lot\", and that everyone else just relented to shut him up.Although Left of the Dial's liner notes work as a cheat sheet, listening to the albums won't tell you anything about how these genres developed, interrelated, or collapsed; simply knowing the facts doesn't tell you why these songs matter. On the other hand, maybe that's the point. It reminds me of buying Rhino's Beg, Scream & Shout box several years ago and enjoying it without knowing anything about the 1960s R&B; singers whose work it collects. It all just seemed to come from some magical past time when great music poured sui generis out of the radio and everybody dug it. As for the struggles, influences, jagged careers, and sad ends that frame the music... maybe someday I'll read the liner notes. My kid might feel the same way about Left of the Dial and ignore my lectures and nostalgia and just enjoy the songs. And fuck it: If the music holds up, that will probably be for the best.\n",

      "Brendan Benson's songs are almost exclusively about girls: nearly every harmony-heavy track buried deep inside Benson's discography contains some sort of nod to a mangled or budding relationship, even if that allusion ends up sitting in the context of an entirely separate story. Ladies are tied to chairs, or eating soft-serve ice cream from Dairy Queen, or helpfully pointing out to everyone that Benson's just \"not John Lennon.\" But no matter how tragic Benson's girl-trouble may occasionally seem, that ache has gotta be dwarfed by the devastation of his industry woes-- if profound major label distrust were to be given a dubious, heartbroken face, it would probably look an awful lot like Benson's sheepish mug.After being pegged as pop/rock's new blonde hero by critics and college DJs in 1996, Benson's promising Virgin Records debut, the effusive One Mississippi, was promptly declared insignificant by label heads, denied a substantial promotional backing, and left to languish peaceably in relative obscurity (see: the vast warehouses of Amazon UK). Virgin had signed Benson based on the strength of an untempered six-song demo, but their flippant dismissal of One Mississippi was preceded by loads of unsolicited meddling: the label had already asked Benson to shelve his original version of the record, produced by co-conspirator and one-time Jellyfish member Jason Falkner (who also co-wrote over half the songs), in order to work with Jane's Addiction/Minutemen producer Ethan James.Benson succumbed to the label's request and dutifully re-recorded One Mississippi with James at the production helm. As agreed, Virgin then shipped the record to radio stations, and Benson nobly attempted his first major support tour, opening for Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers. But with little radio airplay and the still proscenium-shy Benson stumbling around awkwardly on stage, One Mississippi was largely ignored and Benson was dropped by Virgin; unsurprisingly, it took nearly five years for Benson to untangle himself and release a follow-up, 2002's comparably straightforward (but Jack White-endorsed!) Lapalco. Now with independent StarTime International, Benson has released a plumped-up, twenty-two track version of One Mississippi (including the six Falkner-produced tracks and two bonus songs, previously available only on the Japanese version of the LP), complete with gushing, masterpiece-declaring liner notes, thus priming the record for admission into the long-lost-classic canon.One Mississippi deserves much of its hyperbolic praise: showcasing Benson's indisputable songwriting prowess, it's packed with tight melodies, feisty guitar jabs, and some inescapably catchy harmonies, a pop/rock treasure chest that's both impossibly listenable and surprisingly complex; Benson's addictive hooks tend to conceal rich, oddly understated arrangements, and his guitar work can be both Townshend-abrasive and bubblegum easy. For folks who've already managed to wrap their hands around an original copy of One Mississippi, there are enough extras here to justify the investment and satiate completists.The Falkner-produced versions (\"Crosseyed\", \"Me Just Purely\", \"Cherries\", \"I'm Blessed\", and \"Sittin' Pretty\" are all present in duplicate) of One Mississippi's final cuts tend to be more stubbornly lo-fi and generally richer, while \"Christy\", which didn't make it onto the James-produced edition, is a gratifyingly aggressive addition. Still, Brendan Benson's epic tale of major label wreckage is oddly inconclusive: he may have been waylaid and wearied by unsympathetic suits, but-- as if this story could get any more prototypically indie!-- Benson's earliest stuff still stands up as his best.\n",

      "Perry Farrell started out as the most engaging guy who ever hit you up for change. It wasn't just his wiry, damaged looks and a voice that sounded like rent tissue; this guy had stories to tell, about what he saw on the streets, the drugs and hookers, the sound of gunshots and polyglot arguments. Then he'd get in his own head, and spill his wild theories-- sex is violence! Jesus enjoyed a good menage-a-trois every now and again! You can piss in the shower! On yourself!-- and fantasies about the mountains and deserts he'd probably never seen. If you drove in from the 'burbs and met this guy, he'd tell you things you'd never imagined-- but the whole time, he just wanted your money.The three albums that Jane's Addiction cut, from their commercial breakthrough in '88 to their sudden breakup in '91, placed them solidly as one of the great bands of their time. Farrell partnered with star lead guitarist Dave Navarro-- a fellow metal drama queen-- and the stellar rhythm section of Stephen Perkins on drums and bassist Eric Avery: you could send them out on reconnaissance and know they'd come back. Not only did the band help start the \"alternative rock\" era and revive great hard rock on the major labels, but their fusion of metal, goth, punk-funk-grooves and art-rock showed a breadth and power close to none other than Led Zeppelin-- a band whose greatness they scraped with their artistic and commercial pinnacle, Ritual de lo Habitual.And then it was over. Without dwelling on every solo project and spinoff band, you can argue that each new album was safer and duller than the one before. Farrell's Porno for Pyros made him tame and serviceable, as the one-time street threat became the professional concert promoter behind Lollapalooza. With his exotic electronica record Songs Yet to Be Sung, he'd finally made it out to the desert, even if he was too straight and cleaned-up to make anything of it. The others didn't fare much better, but aside from a one-off reunion tour (with Flea on bass), the band had been inactive for over a decade when they got back together-- with Chris Chaney replacing Avery-- to record Strays and revive Lollapalooza, which they're currently headlining. Again.If you're an old fan you might stop cold when you hear the band's new sound. I'll just be direct here: Jane's Addiction have embraced the stainless steel of nu-metal. That said, the old band is recognizable-- Farrell even shouts \"HERE WE GO!\" to kick it off-- but now they're tight, clean and less dynamic; some tracks sound slick enough to fit in a movie about street-racing sports cars. And who thought Farrell's voice would fit the bold, basic hard rock of the single \"Just Because\"?But let's assume none of that bugs you. They went modern, and sometimes they sound like the music your little brother listens to because he's still scared of your records-- but they still knock aside pretty much anything else on commercial rock radio today. The performances are ferocious. Farrell sounds completely committed, pushing more out of his voice than you'd think it could give him. Navarro's leads fly by so often he barely pauses to point them out. Producer Bob Ezrin (Kiss, Alice Cooper, Pink Floyd) deserves credit for catching (or generating) all the excitement in this date, even if the perfection is unnatural: the finishing touches are immaculate, from the light use of keyboards to the occasional choir and horn section, all layered barely above the surface.\"Hypersonic\" is a dizzyingly tight piece of metalcraft that screeches to a giddy finish; \"True Nature\" and \"Wrong Girl\" echo the segues and moody sections of past Jane's tunes, while \"Superhero\", the most cussing (and probably my favorite) song, acts as traditional mid-album sass-swagger, with its catchiest hooks. They sequenced the most creative songs around the clichéd hard rock of \"Price I Pay\" and \"To Match The Sun\", but unfortunately, the album's strengths stop at its construction. Strays lacks what what made the band great in the first place: believable songs and lyrics. According to interviews, the band wrote this material in the studio, so it's not surprising that none of the songs sound like they were burning to be written-- or remembered.The chorus of \"Superhero\" and the Zep-riffs of \"Wrong Girl\" don't excuse the forgettable hooks and by-the-numbers hard rock that fill most of the record. The problem isn't that they didn't write a new \"Jane Says\", it's that none of these songs can touch any of the material from the first three records. The dynamics-- the bass-led segues and sudden avalanches of sound, the hooks and stylistic extremes-- are simply absent. Strays boasts the band's career-worst dog, the ballad \"Everybody's Friend\", with an acoustic guitar part that won't be played in dorm rooms across America, and groaner lines like: \"Men of peace/ Men of war/ Tell me, who knows more?\" And that's more colorful than the kitchen magnet verse on the other songs. Still, as if knowing this, Farrell whizzes through and preferentially emphasizes the timbre of his voice over what he's saying: the lyrics have gotten wordier, yet none of them sound like they matter.It's hard to go from the songs on Ritual that seemed torn from Farrell's guts to this one-dimensional writing, but to be fair, those comparisons ignore that twelve years have passed. Farrell's not the man he was-- and nobody wants to hear a fortysomething sing about living clean and studying the Torah. He's in a different life: he's done letting us live vicariously through his mania. Judging from Strays, he and the band aren't out to add to the significance of their earlier work; they take the momentous quality of their reunion momentum and aim for the ages. At least they want to rock. For a reunion cash-in, that's saying a lot.\n",

      "New York's Electric Turn to Me should be a lesson to us all. Counting two former members of the excellent but defunct Laddio Bolocko, and fronted by a German woman called Silke-- clearly unafraid of bringing the drama like Siouxsie used to do-- the band should add up to a fairly sizeable fish in the tiny, usually refreshing pond of neo art-rock. However, some funny things happened on the way to the next big thing: sinister theatrics became campy cabaret, digital age psychedelia lapsed into flat, by-the-numbers post-rock, and a modern take on the otherworldly grandeur of The Doors became a lightweight, impotent Jane's Addiction run-through. The lesson-- especially for Laddio Bolocko fans-- might be that you can't always get what you want. For anyone else, maybe something like \"steer clear of falling stars.\"Electric Turn to Me was formed last summer, apparently inspired by eccentric 60s psyche-pop acts like Love and Pretty Things, though to my ears not even in the same universe. Where the Pretty Things were scruffy mod rockers with hearts of art, sounding as convincing on the folk-laced \"Private Sorrow\" as they did on all-out jams like \"Walking Through My Dreams\", ETTM seem a tad forced. It doesn't help that their bassless lineup often fails to really bring the power during frequent \"climactic\" moments, though they do pump up the tympanis on occasion-- yeah! Still, none of that compares to vocalist Silke, who is polarization personified. Her voice is, shall we say, distinctive. Her vibrato is...positively traumatic. For better or for worse, she dominates this music with a thick, wavering tone and Teutonic dread that gives me sore throat just thinking about it. It's not going to take most folks long to determine if they can handle her.The best moment on Electric Turn to Me is its first 30 seconds, as the band blasts out of the gate on \"First Crimes\" playing hyperspeed, electro-fied rocket rock very reminiscent of Laddio Bolocko. And then, she happens. \"FIRRRRST CRIIIIMES, EVERYDAYNIGHTWHENTHEMOONTHOUGHTSOFYERSIDE.\" Well, I can't really tell what she's singing, but her message is loud and clear: bow down before my black terror, o subjects of despair! The vampire movie organ that accompanies her does a nice job of transforming the vibe from threepenny operatic tension into is-this-supposed-to-be-funny rocky horror. A minute later, Silke manages to unleash the full power of her sonic arsenal, and all I can think of is that scene in Lord of the Rings when Cate Blanchett freaks out and turns silver and blue.\"Watch Out for the Witch\" is slightly less over the top, though clearly the band missed an opportunity here when they titled the record. Drummer Blake Fleming's ultra-tight pulse, alongside the clipped, distorted keyboard figure make for a decent (and mercifully straightforward-- never thought I'd be so grateful for that) backdrop over which Silke plays it cool for a little bit. Of course, she lets loose in the chorus, but the song itself isn't a bad update on 60s rock opera a la S.F. Sorrow. \"Nightvision\", on the other hand, is pretty dreadful: Silke visits the other extreme of her vocal repertoire, opting for moaning, wavering strains while the band is relegated to the unenviable role of trying to keep the ballad moving lest it dissolve into art-show melodrama. They manage to do this best during the more intense sections, as Fleming hacks at his cymbal and guitarist James Wilk offers a few arpeggios that wouldn't sound out of place on Simple Minds song. Remember, these are the good parts.Despite my various reservations with Electric Turn to Me, I'm not without hope. There is a faint connection between the devastating bombast of Silke and the eccentric (but expressive) work of Dagmar Krause (formerly of Slapp Happy and the Art Bears). Perhaps, like Krause and her bands, Silke and ETTM will develop a sound that makes better use of their various strengths, as I'm certain there must be away to make this mix work. Until then, tread carefully.\n",

      "As it turns out, Gary Lucas' contributions to many of Jeff Buckley's shining moments amounted to much more than just giving him an outlet to unleash his velvet-savage croon fronting the pre-Grace quartet Gods & Monsters, or helping him along with his songs. In fact, the music for some of Buckley's signature tunes like \"Grace\" and \"Mojo Pin\" was almost completely composed by Lucas. As the posthumous releases continue to mount for Buckley, I wonder if the kinds of revelations left are the ones like this that could as likely deflate his legacy as procure the myth. Buckley was an artist, and his leftovers are being deftly distributed in a style similar to other late legends like John Coltrane, Jimi Hendrix and John Lennon (oddly Kurt Cobain has thus far not enjoyed the same extended eulogy)-- and there will doubtlessly come a day when only the bottom of the barrel remains. The good news is that Songs to No One does not mark that day.Buckley had come to New York from California in 1991 with his girlfriend and soon found himself in an artistic community far removed from the cutthroat competition of LA. He met former Captain Beefheart guitarist Gary Lucas at a benefit for Buckley's late father and soon joined Lucas' rock project Gods & Monsters. Buckley supplied lyrics to several of Lucas' instrumentals, including the aforementioned pair that eventually became centerpieces of Buckley's only completed album. But Gods & Monsters never really got off the ground outside of New York, largely due to a growing tension between Buckley and Lucas. When Buckley refused to sign an agreement regarding his loyalty to the project, they effectively called it quits. Songs to No One features two of their songs, plus several more recorded privately by Lucas and Buckley, as well as a few other solo and duet performances.The highlight of the collection, and one of the finest Buckley performances outside of Grace, is the first track, a cover of Edith Piaf's \"Hymne a l'Amour\". Recorded at Lucas' residence, the track ebbs and flows on a mystical drone, transforming a quaint melody into an alluring raga. The looped guitar figure provides just enough rhythmic structure to support Buckley's already stunning voice. Lucas' soaring string-scapes supply the heady atmosphere, and the overall effect is not unlike something Buckley's dad would have committed to tape circa 1970's radical Starsailor. Similarly, the spare versions of \"Mojo Pin\" and \"Grace\" (featured twice on this set: once as a studio demo with band; once as a live duet) demonstrate that these guys had merely to find the right band and producer-- the songs themselves were almost fully formed.The Gods & Monsters tracks showcase the rock star barely inside Buckley, as both \"Cruel\" and \"Malign Fiesta (No Soul)\" forgo subtle phrasing for aggressive pounce. The former track is pretty grungy, like a cross between Stone Temple Pilots and Buckley's own \"Eternal Life\". Lucas' twangy lead keeps it out of the gutter, though even he can't salvage the peppy, sub-Jane's Addiction snort of the latter song. (\"You're 24 years old and still don't know which way the wind blows.\" Hmm.) Fairing better is the version of \"She is Free\" with downtown avant-jazz group Sex Mob. This track was constructed \"Free as a Bird\"-style, with the band supplying their new backup to Buckley and Lucas' 1992 rehearsal tape. Sure, it seems a little creepy, but Sex Mob's tasteful roots-groove provides a smooth tapestry for Buckley's soulful strains. Similarly, Bill Frisell provides guitars after-the-fact to \"Satisfied Mind\".Other than Lucas' considerable contributions, what strikes me about this set is Buckley's already remarkable range of expression. Although some of the songs (particularly the G&M; numbers) would seem ill-suited to his strengths, Buckley dove into each performance as if it was the only one he would ever give, and manages to make all of this music his own. On the title track, an upbeat pop number that wouldn't have sounded out of place on Paul Simon's Graceland, Buckley implores the object of his affections to \"know this song for always\", yet \"show this song to no one\". Perhaps due to the vigor that went into these performances (and who knows what other ones that remain), that last request seems impossible now. Hopefully, any future installments have as much to offer.\n",

      "Once upon a time, everything the local \"modern rock\" station played sounded like The Friends of Rachel Worth. Before Papa Roach, before the Presidents of the United States of America, before even the Toadies, the likes of the Lightning Seeds, Lloyd Cole, and the Blue Aeroplanes dominated the alternative airwaves. I'm not going to attempt some kind of authoritative history of the era, since I didn't get a chance to exercise my 12 year-old critical skills that often before Nirvana broke. As I recall it, though, there were lots of keyboard-augmented, mid-tempo British (and faux-British) bands, tempered only by the occasional Jane's Addiction outburst.The Go-Betweens were better than that scene, and content to be Australian. But their sound wasn't fundamentally different from many bands in the post-new wave/ pre-grunge era. When Robert Forster and Grant McLennan released the first Go-Betweens album in 1981, their smart, organic approach to pop was no doubt refreshing. Still, by the time they disbanded in 1989, there were numerous aspirants to the clever pop throne, and even if those bands never wrote songs quite as well as the Go-Betweens, they often sold more records.The album opens on a high note with McLennan's \"Magic in Here,\" a tuneful, bittersweet anthem with a propulsive bass line. But while 11 years have passed since the last Go-Betweens album saw release, the band's sound hasn't changed significantly. Yes, Forster and McLennan recruited a good percentage of the northwest indie scene to appear on this record (Elliott Smith, Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein of Sleater-Kinney, Sam Coomes of Quasi, and Janet Weiss of, erm, both), but their presence is largely undetectable. \"The Clock\" is a notable exception, beginning with an unmistakable edgy Brownstein riff, but the song quickly retreats into wistful jangle-pop. Even when Tucker contributes her normally explosive vocals to \"Going Blind,\" her harmonies with McLennan evoke Papas Fritas more than punk rock.I'm not deluded. I didn't expect the Go-Betweens to start rocking just because they hung out in Portland for a little while. In fact, \"German Farmhouse,\" the most aggressive song on the album, is easily its least appealing. When the aging Forster makes a shaky attempt at bravado and earnestly croons, \"There was a rumor that Pavarotti would sing there/ To raise funds for a music school, but then the whole thing just vanished into thin air/ I said, thin air,\" it's just too much to take.Forster's songwriting, in fact, proves consistently disappointing. \"Spirit\" and \"When She Sang about Angels,\" a tribute to Patti Smith, strive for meaningful sentiment, but Forster's awkward phrasing makes it difficult to listen to without a smirk. \"When she sang about a boy/ Kurt Cobain/ I thought what a shame/ It wasn't about/ Tom Verlaine.\" Uh, what? It's dispiriting to see the composer of gems like \"Spring Rain\" and \"The House That Jack Kerouac Built\" in such poor form.For a band returning from a decade-long sabbatical, these guys are surprisingly spry. Their consistency is also, to some degree, their downfall, since they still sound uncannily mid-'80s. And whereas past Go-Betweens records, like 1984's Spring Hill Fair and 1988's 16 Lovers Lane, have maintained their charm after the passage of more than a decade, The Friends of Rachel Worth comes off as a relic of another era. New generations of Aussie pop bands have emerged since those early days, and the wit and harmonies of the Lucksmiths and the subtle melancholy of Sodastream sound fresher and more relevant now. But even past their prime, the Go-Betweens are still better than anything on present alternative radio playlists.\n",

      "In a weekend fraught with poor decisions, this was by far the worst: I agreed to meet up with a few alumni friends at the college we graduated from last year. We ended up sitting around in once-familiar (now unfamiliar) campus houses, without even a buzz to speak of. While in one of these houses, I actually resorted to watching TV. VH1 was offering their, ahem, definitive list of the 100 Greatest Bands of Hard Rock, complete with James Hetfield and Henry Rollins, among others, waxing critical about the historical significance of second-rate tripe like Alice in Chains and Stone Temple Pilots.While I was nicely surprised by some inclusions-- Fugazi (#95), the Pixies (#81), Hüsker Dü (#68), and Jane's Addiction (#35), for instance-- I was mostly appalled. Like I didn't see it coming. First, there was the problem of order. Mötley Crüe are #29, while the Rolling Stones were covered only briefly at #67. Good one! There was also a noticeable lack of coherent determining criteria. Judging by their list, I'd guess the editors at VH1 consider the Red Hot Chili Peppers (#30) and Foo Fighters (#72) \"hard rock,\" but not David Bowie. There were, of course, countless other omissions, particularly in the area of punk. New York Dolls, the Stooges, and the Sex Pistols appear at numbers 60, 27 and 12, respectively. But Wire, Gang of Four, and Television-- all left out.And left out in favor whom? I've already mentioned four poor choices, and there are plenty more. Korn (#53), anyone? Looking down the list, it becomes apparent that VH1 really means \"heavy metal\" when it says \"hard rock\": Iron Maiden (#24), Pantera (#45), the Scorpions (#46), Slayer (#50), Megadeth (#69), Ratt (#79)-- and that's just a few. But people, please. Do I really need to continue after Ratt? Okay, one more: Quiet Riot (#100).The way some critics have drooled over Cave In's second true full-length, Jupiter, you'd think the band would be destined to make this list when VH1 revises it in 2010. Some company this Boston four-piece would have. But, in all seriousness, they'd fit right in-- from their music all the way down to their pomposity: visiting their website, you'll be met by a Shockwave Flash intro that reads, \"The future of music is on Jupiter. Perception will be altered. Preconceptions will be shattered. Jupiter has landed.\" I believe Damon Albarn said it all with his timeless phrase, \"Woo-hoo.\"I wish I could tell you what the site says after that, but it's so graphics-heavy that it ground my computer to a halt. Now replace \"site\" with \"album,\" and \"my computer\" with \"my brain\": this is how I responded to Jupiter. The album might betray fans of Cave In's earlier albums, 1999's Beyond Hypothermia (a collection of various sessions) and Until Your Heart Stops. Their metal roots are still apparent, but their new sound will, uh, shatter preconceptions. Their last release, the Creative Eclipses EP, hinted at this development, but only now have Cave In fully suffused their music with heavy prog and space-rock flourishes.Admittedly, the opening title track isn't much of a departure. \"Jupiter\" rips open with some standard chunky riffs while frontman Steve Brodsky gives it his trademark high-school talent show best with lines like, \"The metronome is wrong again/ My heart has surely gone and skipped a beat.\" Only with the vocal mirroring of a Middle Eastern-style guitar lick does it become apparent that things are different this time around. The next track, \"In the Stream of Commerce,\" straddles the line. The chorus remains derivative hard rock, stuffed with present-day Weilandisms, but the verse offers lofty, reverberated guitar stylings and even a hackneyed falsetto. We all know who also sounds like this, so I'm not going to say the R-word. (Rush; #28)Jupiter moves further away from its metal leanings as it progresses. The seven-minute \"Big Riff\" contains just that, along with some guttural, \"I'm going to eat your children\" vocals, but, as suggested by its length, there's plenty of heads-down string-picking. During these moments, Cave In resemble a directionless version of Hum. Meanwhile, \"Innuendo and Out the Other\" is like a long, drawn out version of \"Black Hole Sun\" with no chorus; the nine-minute \"Requiem\" is more self-indulgent, um, post-metal-- only longer; \"Decay of the Delay\" is an angular, if overly consistent instrumental. And the closer, \"New Moon,\" moves from an acoustic opening to a raucous, metal climax. Which, as you know, has never been done before.If you still have a soft spot for heavy metal, but can't bring yourself to dig up those old Def Leppard (#31) records, Jupiter's just what you've been searching for. It's metal without the guilt; in other words, it's arty metal-- which is why some critics have embraced it (this, by the way, is also why Queens of the Stone Age have received so much undeserved press). But Jupiter actually makes me yearn for those old Leppard records, if only to hear the real thing.\n"

       "'Imagine if the Caretaker were more into RZA than early jazz, spinning detuned and damaged stabs of harp and piano into loops that stumble atop crumbling percussion. The new BlackTaffy LP by Dallas’ Donovan Jones, a former member of heavy postrock act ThisWillDestroyYou, is that image, shivering into life. The enchanting instrumentals of Elder Mantis (even the title seems ripped from the WuTang manual, right?) rise up like mirages from smoothly spreading bass lines, slowly skidding claps and snares, and dusty scraps of harp and koto. The overall effect is like Liquid Swords stripped of GZA and reworked as a meditation exercise.That’s one way of hearing it, of course: You could also say it’s like JDilla and BoardsofCanada blending into a sinister Bibio, or a boombap HaroldBudd. However you slice it, there is something distinctly timestamped about BlackTaffy, pitched between soulstreaked glitchhop and beardstroking bedroom electronic. This is the sort of record that would have sparked a minor bidding war between Stones Throw and Ninja Tune a little more than a decade ago.But Elder Mantis is more than a dated genre exercise because of its liminal position between genres and its modern sense of hollow, haunting, almost Buriallike space. Jones has found a voice of his own among his touchstones, one that knocks like hiphop, wobbles like IDM, and hovers like ambient. For something so restrained and hypnotically webbed with shuddering loops, Elder Mantis has a striking sense of musical eloquence and variety. Where “Divining Rod” quivers and drifts like its namesake, tracks like “Corridors” and “Switchback” scroll by in steady breaths, so that the record is constantly tightening or slackening, as if on a spool.Unlike many of his reference points, Jones doesn’t let things blur into murk. He cultivates a rare atmosphere that is at once clear and polluted, spacious and looming, relaxing and uneasy. Elder Mantis thrives on the pleasure of hearing a sparse, precisely defined palette thoughtfully interpreted through a set of colorways and feelings. The simple elements are legible but pitched at a slant, creating a tension that allows each of these pieces to be more than the sum of discernible parts. Each stereo pop, frequency notch, or sprungclockwork drum seems placed by hand, and unsuspected melodies keep rising from beneath them, like gas from cracks in the earth. From the slithery “Land of Nod” to the elegant noir of “Windflower,” the lush string sweeps of “Geraldine” to the Laraajistyle zither hymn “The Empty Mirror,” Jones contrives all manner of subtle drops, openings, and turns without ever rising above a hushed drift. It’s an alert album that, turns out, is also great for drifting to sleep.'"

       "'Imagine a graphic showing all the bands the five members of Tortoise were in before they came together and then all the bands they went on to play with after. At the top of the funnel you have groups ranging from dreamy psych-rock to earthy post-punk crunch, including Eleventh Dream Day, Bastro, Slint, and the Poster Children; on the “post-Tortoise” end are groups focusing on electro-jazz and twangy instrumental rock like Isotope 217, Chicago Underground, and Brokeback. In this graphic, Tortoise is the choke point, the one project that has elements of all these sounds but is never defined by nor committed to any of them.Instead, Tortoise floats free, a planchette moving over a Ouija board guided by 10 sets of fingers, where everyone watches the arrow float in one direction but no one is quite sure how it gets there or who is doing the pushing. No album in the band’s initial run embodied that like their third, 1998’s TNT. Weirdly beautiful and impossible to pin down, TNT was a fulcrum, a place where the musical values of the past (instrumental proficiency, deliberate composition) met the digital future.But first we should start with that past, with a rhythm section, or rather, two of them. The first of these came together when drummer John Herndon and bassist Doug McCombs became friends and started playing together in Chicago in the early 1990s. Entering a studio with producer Brad Wood to record an early single, Herndon and McCombs overdubbed multiple parts to flesh out the sound but realized they needed more musicians for what they had in mind. They played the tapes for their acquaintances, drummer John McEntire and bassist Bundy K. Brown, who formed the rhythm section for the Louisville-based post-hardcore group Bastro, and soon after, the four players, along with percussionist Dan Bitney, became Tortoise.If the early ’90s was the perfect time for a band like Tortoise to emerge, Chicago was the perfect place. The city’s burgeoning independent music scene was attracting national attention. After the post-Nirvana alternative rock explosion, the hunt for “the next Seattle” was on, and Chicago was one of the candidates. In 1993, Billboard published a piece touting Chicago as “Cutting Edge’s New Capital,” citing the buzz around artists like Liz Phair, Urge Overkill, and Smashing Pumpkins. But if the national press was more focused on the MTV-ready alt acts, that meant that the underground was free to do their thing far from the glare of the spotlight. For Chicago, the building blocks of such a scene were the city’s record labels, particularly Touch and Go, Drag City, and, beginning in 1995, when it moved from New York, an upstart imprint called Thrill Jockey launched by former Atlantic A&R rep Bettina Richards.After bassist Brown had been replaced by ex-Slint guitarist and bassist Dave Pajo, Tortoise began moving fluidly between musical worlds. An experimental strain of music using rock instrumentation was emerging, and “post-rock” seemed to fit as a blanket description. Initially, the term applied to UK bands like Disco Inferno and Bark Psychosis, but a framework for understanding this music from the U.S. was laid out by critic Simon Reynolds in a late 1995 piece for The Wire. As Reynolds pointed out, the American flavor of post-rock (the piece highlights Tortoise, Labradford, UI, Stars of the Lid, and more) could be thought of as anti-grunge, a music that suggested a headier and less earthbound alternative to the alternative. “Grunge literally means ‘grime,’ ‘muck,’ ‘dirt,’ Reynolds wrote. “It’s appropriate that so many of those in revolt against Grunge’s earthly passion have turned to science fiction and outer space in order to free up their imaginations.”Guitars dominated the grunge-derived strand of music, but post-rock left room for electronics and other instruments. McEntire was Tortoise’s resident tech wizard, and the band’s M.O. moved from the thudding beats of the debut into something that could fit with what was happening with various strands of electronic music. On Virgin’s 1995 set of dark atmospheric electronica, Macro Dub Infection, Tortoise appeared alongside Spring Heel Jack, 4 Hero, Tricky, and the Mad Professor. And in 1996, they were included in Mo’ Wax’s blunted head-nodding 2-CD trip-hop set Headz 2A, sandwiched between songs by DJ Krush and Massive Attack. Tortoise didn’t exactly fit on either compilation—they were too disjointed, too ready to leave the groove behind if something else caught their fancy. But these compilation placements helped to reframe their music as a studio creation first, something assembled from parts.Remixing was in vogue, and Tortoise embraced it. The astonishing 20-minute journey “Djed,” the opening track from their second album, 1996’s Millions Now Living Will Never Die, put the idea of after-performance manipulation at the center of the piece, as a deep-pocket groove is born, develops, and shatters halfway through in a moment of digital haywire that sounded like a mistake. That garbled transmission when the piece implodes provided a clue as to what the next record might be about.TNT took the ideas of “Djed” further into the creative possibilities of nonlinear editing. It was recorded to hard disk via Pro Tools, a relatively new idea on the music scene when they started working on the album in late 1996 (Stereolab’s Dots and Loops, engineered by McEntire around the same time, was another early entry for the technology). TNT is a record where copy, cut, paste, and undo reign supreme. Individual parts were worked up in rehearsals, recorded in various combinations, and later reconfigured into new pieces of music by McEntire and the band.One of the delicious tensions of TNT is its ex post facto assembly. It doesn’t really sound like music created by careful manipulation of each bit and put together from parts. You almost always have a sense that individual people, not machines, are playing each part and even though the players’ skill ranges from “highly accomplished” to “virtuoso,” the pieces also sound human. You can see hands on keys and people standing over drum kits. Beats are a bit off-kilter, the guitar seems in dialogue with the bass.TNT’s opening title track is the most live-sounding cut on the record, but it, too, was carefully built one part at a time. As it begins, the cymbals and snare taps are like the tide rolling in, the skitters and crashes are as jazzy as Tortoise get, and out of this foamy pile emerges Jeff Parker’s immortal guitar line. Parker was new to the band, and was the first player to bring serious jazz chops, with his history with Chicago’s legendary collective AACM. He announced his arrival in Tortoise with a guitar phrase that might be the group’s most memorable single moment, a riff that sums up not only the album’s mood but the spirit of an entire era. Parker’s 12-note phrase seems to ask a question and then half answer it, and because it conveys the feeling of an incomplete thought, it leaves a space for the listener to fill. Driven by that guitar refrain, which loops throughout the track, “TNT” folds in horns, a sequencer, and chunky bass as Parker offers counterpoint phrases. You can feel both how “played” it is alongside the album’s modular nature, where each part is slid into place as it grows and then explodes. “TNT” conveys possibility—it’s a musical expression of what it feels like to wonder about the future on an album that feels like it’s living inside of it.Nothing else on the record is quite so dynamic or organic. Instead, TNT settles into a liminal zone that straddles genres and threatens to slip into the background but never does. It’s a vague record, but that’s actually one of its strengths—the music frames uncertainty, leaves avenues unexplored, and sounds a little different each time you hear it. Many of the tracks flow one into the next, and motifs appear and then reappear later. A few songs become loosely joined pairs as one idea is introduced and then explored later from a different angle. It’s an album that seems to be in conversation with itself.The hiss of the closing cymbals in “TNT” cross-fades into the bass-driven mood piece “Swung From the Gutters,” a quiet track that feels like a lost interlude on the Grateful Dead’s Blues for Allah. This focus on a simple melody connects it to “The Suspension Bridge at Iguazú Falls,” which shows up later on the album but unfolds at a much more deliberate pace. None of these nods to genre are played completely straight. “I Set My Face to the Hillside” opens with the voices of playing children before a nylon-stringed guitar enters, carrying a memory of flamenco that blooms out like the soundtracks of Ennio Morricone. That sound was already an established template for Tortoise, but here they tweak it. On “Set My Face,” you can almost hear the clop of horseshoes in the drums, but then the main melody enters, played on melodica, and you imagine Augustus Pablo meeting the Ventures uptown.Other references are more of-the-moment. On “Almost Always Is Nearly Enough,” Tortoise do a convincing imitation of the squelching, endearingly awkward electro-pop that Mouse on Mars was releasing on Thrill Jockey around this time, complete with fluttering programmed beats and a squawking robotic vocal. That vocal continues through “Jetty,” which gets close to dance music proper, with a jittery forward-leaning beat. “The Equator” is loping electro, a wobbly gurgle of a bassline percolating below a twinkly electronic drone and a slide guitar. The defining word for all these tracks is “almost”—they hint at the work of other artists and embody a range of styles, but they never go all the way. Tortoise were never interested in making actual dance music, the same way they never wanted to improvise in a conventional way. The music is about what happens in the cracks.“The focus is definitely shifting to the treble over the last couple of records,” McEntire told Billboard in early 1998. He was talking about the use of mallet instruments, especially the marimba, which pops up frequently on TNT. “Ten-Day Interval” and its companion piece “Four-Day Interval” pick up the Steve Reich thread that wound through parts of Millions Now Living and make it more explicit. “Ten-Day” is comparatively dense and busy, while “Four-Day” feels like a ghost of its predecessor, ticking along at half the pace and unfolding with twice the space. Tortoise’s take on Reichian repetition has an appealing pop edge to it, foregoing long-form trance induction and instead laying out a basic premise: tweak the rhythm with bits of piano, bass, and percussion, and get out. All the pieces function together, and none, with the possible exception of the title track, draw undue attention to themselves.For their first two albums, Tortoise received almost nothing but raves, but the reaction to TNT was initially mixed. It seemed to pull back slightly after the first two albums strained against limitations. Where the band once shattered conventions, now their music was quiet, pretty, and worked in the background of a dinner party. SPIN thought TNT was accomplished but ultimately bloodless and antiseptic, while The Wire called it “one of the least explosive records ever made, and one of the most gently perplexing.” Neither criticism is unfair, but both inadvertently point to what makes this record special—its essential in-between-ness. Jeff Parker told CMJ in 1998, “People expect everything to be so obvious. But life isn’t like that, so why should music be like that?” TNT is not about certainty. It’s a free-floating work that tends to find a different meaning everywhere it lands, an album that’s beautiful on the surface but gets harder to parse the deeper you go. To enjoy it is to embrace that uneasy sense of not-knowing, of luxuriating in a sound that doesn’t tell you what to feel.'"
