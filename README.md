The goal of this project is to understand how music reivews are written, and see if there are differences between genres or how well the review is written.

You can see my blog post about the project here:<br>

The main steps were: <br>

1. [Scrape all 21000 reviews and save them in a CSV](https://github.com/blakespencer/nlp-pitchfork-reviews/blob/master/pitchfork_scrape.ipynb)
2. [Clean the text](https://github.com/blakespencer/nlp-pitchfork-reviews/blob/master/cleaning_data.ipynb)
3. [Topic Model](https://github.com)
4. [Visualize the Data](https://blake-spencer-projects.herokuapp.com/nlp)

Each of the links above is a Jupyter Notebook file with Python code to complete each step.
